Joshuaâ€™s grandfather is a Wisconsin Ojibwe Indian who, along with an array of quirky characters, runs a recreated sixteenth-century village for the tourists who visit the reservation. Joshuaâ€™s mother kept him from his Ojibwe heritage, so living on the reservation is liberating for him. The more he learns about Ojibwe traditions, the more he feels at home.\r\n\r\nOne Ojibwe legend in particular captivates him. Pukawiss was a powerful manitou known for introducing dance to his people, and his nontraditional lifestyle inspires Joshua to embrace both his burgeoning sexuality and his status as an outcast. Ultimately, Joshua summons the courage necessary to reject his strict upbringing and to accept the mysterious path set before him.\r\n            -----------------------------------------------------------\r\nA Scout is Brave:\r\n           https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23599991-a-scout-is-brave\r\n\r\nIn the months following the brutal murder of Matthew Shepard, fourteen-year-old Joshua, a half Native American boy, is new to a Boy Scout troop and spending a week camping in northern Wisconsin. The weaker kids in the troop soon realize Joshua is not afraid to stand up to the troop's ruthless bullies. Joshuaâ€™s bravery and kindness is infectious, and the bullied Scouts quickly find their own inner strength.\r\n\r\nJoshua, however, is plagued by self-doubt as he realizes he has feelings for Cody, the son of the troopâ€™s harsh and puritanical Scoutmaster. The two discover they have more in common than Scouting as they share their deepest secrets and develop a close friendship. That friendship faces its greatest challenge as the homophobic bullies claim a â€œfaggotâ€ has â€œinfectedâ€ their troop. As if struggling to come to terms with his sexuality while dealing with hatred and bigotry isnâ€™t enough, Joshua discovers the camp holds another dark mystery, one that will make him summon all his courage and learn for the first time what it truly means to be brave","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:891216fb23999dbf272525f6f7ff461771d441df","amp;dn":"The+Two-Spirit+Chronicles+-+Jordan+Jay+Hawke","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"891216fb23999dbf272525f6f7ff461771d441df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,18,22,251,35,153,157,191,39,37,37,246,247,255,70,23,113,212,65,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
