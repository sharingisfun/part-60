The Journal of Curious Letters [The 13th Reality, #01] - James Dashner\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€œWonderful . . . Dashner shares with Rowling a nimble use of fancy, delayed revelation, and charm.â€ â€” Chicago Sun Times\r\n\r\nWhat if every time you made a choice that had a significant consequence, a new, alternate reality was created â€” the life that would've been had you made the other choice? What if those new realities were in danger? What if it fell to you to save all the realities?\r\n\r\nAtticus Higginbottom, a.k.a. Tick, is an average thirteen-year-old boy until the day a strange letter arrives in his mailbox. Postmarked from Alaska and cryptically signed with the initials &quot;M.G.,&quot; the letter informs Tick that dangerous â€” perhaps even deadly â€” events have been set in motion that could result in the destruction of reality itself. M.G. promises to send Tick twelve riddles that will reveal on a certain day, at a certain time, at a certain place, something extraordinary will happen. Will Tick have the courage to follow the twelve clues M.G. sends to him? Will he be able to solve the riddles in time? Will Tick discover the life he was meant to live?\r\n\r\nThe first volume of an outstanding new children's fantasy series, The Journal of Curious Letters is filled with adventure, humor, riddles, and, oh, yes â€” danger. . . As M.G. warns Tick, Very frightening things are coming your way. Will you join Tick and his friends on an amazing journey through the Realities? What will your choice be?\r\n\r\n02.

Dashner shares with Rowling a nimble use of fancy, delayed revelation, and charm.â€ â€” Chicago Sun Times\r\n\r\nItâ€™s been a quiet summer for Tick, Paul, and Sofia, but the latest message from Master George changes everything.\r\n\r\nThe Realities are in danger â€” and from something more terrible than Mistress Jane and the mutated Chiâ€™karda of the Thirteenth Reality. People from all Realities are unexplainably going insane. Worse, some Realities are fragmenting, disintegrating into nothingness. Master George has learned that Mr. Chu from the Fourth Reality is working on a mysterious new weapon called Dark Infinity. But no one has any idea how to stop the weapon â€” or even if it can be stopped.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, Tick and his friends have been kidnapped, forced to wink from Reality to Reality, solving impossible riddles in order to survive the deadly traps surrounding them.\r\n\r\nMistress Jane and Tick find themselves in a race to reach the weapon first â€” but who will destroy it and who will become its master?\r\n\r\n03.

But just as he begins to make progress, Mistress Jane reappears, now hideously scarred and much more powerful. She has tapped into the universeâ€™s darkest secret to create the Blade of Shattered Hope, and in her quest to attain a Utopian Reality for the future of mankind, sheâ€™s ready to risk billions of livesâ€”including those of Tickâ€™s parents and sistersâ€”to set her plan in motion. Her vengeance knows no bounds. When rumors begin to circulate about the secret scientific experiments taking place at the Factory, Tick and his friends Sato, Sofia, and Paul are faced with their most dangerous task yet.

And they must escape. An all-consuming void has opened up and is unleashing monsters throughout the Realities. All of reality is unraveling at the seams and Tick's friends and fellow Realitants are facing an epic war that could spell the end of the universe itself. Mister George has one last weapon at his disposal howeverâ€”the mysterious and powerful Karma button. But using it might be even more dangerous than anyone imagined.
