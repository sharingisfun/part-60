Will she use her knowledge to help a lost child, and lose that handsome EMT as well as her reputation?\r\n\r\nNaomi has been abandoned too many times in her life to believe Tom when he says he will return. Can she find faith?\r\n\r\nCandace is a new forest ranger finding peace but still bitter from lost love. Logan awakens her desires, but he is cool and distant, too involved in his work to notice.
