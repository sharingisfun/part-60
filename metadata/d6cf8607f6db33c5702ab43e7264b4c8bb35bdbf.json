He recorded the album with his then-girlfriend, vocalist Martina Topley-Bird, who sang on most of the songs with him. Tricky produced the album mostly himself at his home studio in London, with the assistance of co-producer Mark Saunders.\r\n\r\nWhen Maxinquaye was released on 20 February 1995 by 4th &amp; B'way Records, it charted at number three in the United Kingdom and received widespread acclaim from critics, many of whom hailed it as the year's best record. It was also viewed as the key album of a musical style that was being dubbed trip hop, a term Tricky himself disliked. Since then, Maxinquaye has been ranked frequently on all-time lists of the greatest albums and has sold over 500,000 copies worldwide.
