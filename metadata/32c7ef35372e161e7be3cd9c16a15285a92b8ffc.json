Itâ€™s easy to learn and simple to play but surprisingly deep and difficult to master at later levels, presenting even the most veteran of puzzle enthusiasts with brain-tickling challenge.\r\n\r\nPrismatica's aesthetic design and feel is intended to be calm and essentialist, presenting the player with a pure puzzle to focus on solving in a flowing natural way. A hauntingly beautiful soundtrack from award winning indie folk musician Svavar Knutur reinforces the stoic atmosphere of contemplation and mental challenge presented by the deceptively simple looking puzzles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32c7ef35372e161e7be3cd9c16a15285a92b8ffc","amp;dn":"Prismatica+v1.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32c7ef35372e161e7be3cd9c16a15285a92b8ffc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,199,239,53,55,46,22,30,123,227,205,156,22,161,82,133,169,43,143,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
