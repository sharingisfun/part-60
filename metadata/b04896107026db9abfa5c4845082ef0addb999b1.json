Miles From Nowhere is an adventure not to be missed!\r\n\r\nAlong the way, these near-neophyte cyclists encountered warm-hearted strangers eager to share food and shelter, bicycle-hating drivers who shoved them off the road, various wild animals (including a roof ape and an attack camel), sacred cows, rock-throwing Egyptians, overprotective Thai policeman, motherly New Zealanders, meteorological disasters, bodily indignities, and great personal joys. The stress of traveling together constantly for two years tested and ultimately strengthened the young couple's relationship","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b04896107026db9abfa5c4845082ef0addb999b1","amp;dn":"Barbara+Savage+-+Miles+From+Nowhere+%5B1988%5D+%5BAudiobook%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b04896107026db9abfa5c4845082ef0addb999b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,72,150,16,112,38,219,154,191,165,196,132,80,130,239,10,221,185,153,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
