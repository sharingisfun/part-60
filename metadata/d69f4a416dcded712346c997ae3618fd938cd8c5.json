If you look behind the scenes, there are many famous names that make people curious about the 10 track strong disk. Behind the band hides none other than multi-instrumentalist JP Genkel, known as guitarist of Lacrimosa. But in the trades is still far more...\r\nAlready the opener &quot;Black Stone&quot; begins tremendous sound and simultaneously mystical and menacing. Easily classified first one does not know the sound. Dark Rock it hits! \r\nThe powerful dark guitar riffs dressed ominously through the whole song, while the vocals slightly electronically distorted as a strange voice sound from the heart: &quot;The secret is just written down there, right down below, Blackstone what can you tell me will I ever know? &quot;Whether this question can be answered in the following pieces? &quot;Hurt&quot; is when it comes to dark guitar riffs one on top of \r\nanother.\r\n-----\r\nYear:\t2014\r\nStyle:\tDark Metal\r\n\r\nAdditional:\tGothic Metal\r\nCountry:\tGermany\r\n\r\nFormat:\t320 mp3\r\nSize:\t121.93 MB\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAdded:\t04/01/2016 \r\n\r\nFiles:\t11\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription:\t\r\nLength : 00:52:49\r\n\r\n\r\nTracks:\r\n\r\n01.
