The filmâ€™s events take place during a brutal blizzard in Wyoming a few years after the American Civil War. Bounty hunter John â€œThe Hangmanâ€ Ruth (Kurt Russell) is rushing toward Red Rock, Wyoming, to collect pay for his fugitive prisoner (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Along the way he encounters another bounty hunter (Samuel L. Jackson) and the supposed sheriff of Red Rock (Walton Goggins). The party seeks shelter from the storm at a stagecoach stopover where they meet four strangers who are also waiting out the blizzard. Over the next few hours we learn that everything is not as it seems.\r\n\r\nOff the bat, itâ€™s necessary to mention that everyone in this movie is great. Tarantino favourites like Russell, Jackson, Michael Madsen and Tim Roth are always guaranteed to performâ€”and they definitely do in this movie, with each one owning his role. But the real standouts are Leigh, as the fugitive Daisy Domergue, and Channing Tatum. Leighâ€™s fiery and grotesque performance is awesome; sheâ€™s able to provoke laughs from the audience while maintaining a sense of danger and desperation when necessary. Meanwhile Tatum, in a role I wonâ€™t mention so I donâ€™t spoil it, is surprisingly great. Heâ€™s proven to be a gifted comedian, but in this film heâ€™s able to be someone very different and we are all able to forget his heartthrob status.\r\n\r\nIn true Tarantino fashion, the dialogue is a highlight. Itâ€™s pithy and funny, and it fills the lull of travelling in a stagecoach. Bonus points for making the word â€œyonderâ€ sound cool. The majority of the action of the film takes place in the stagecoach stopover, which is basically a glorified log cabin. That Tarantino can pull this off without giving the viewer a sense of cabin fever speaks to the quality of the filmâ€™s script, and to the acting as well. All this expository dialogue teases the second half of the film, when the film switches gears in a spectacular, bloody way. The gore in this movie is practically demure compared to some of Tarantinoâ€™s other movies (The Crazy 88 sequence from Kill Bill and the last bit of Django Unchained come to mind) but itâ€™s definitely still thereâ€”and welcomed, of course.\r\n\r\nThis movie looks beautiful too. Despite taking place in a wretched blizzard, the filmâ€™s sweeping landscapes and wide white hills are gorgeous. It was originally filmed in 70mm and this aspect ratio may play a part in that. And itâ€™s no surprise that Ennio Morriconeâ€™s score is epic and adds to the Western feel of the film. \r\n \nhttp://thetfs.ca/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16b479cba1a1a93c3f8d72b60377be97903ebdfb","amp;dn":"The+Hateful+Eight+2015+688X256p+x264+mp4+Makalakato","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16b479cba1a1a93c3f8d72b60377be97903ebdfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,180,121,203,161,161,169,60,63,141,114,182,3,119,190,151,144,62,189,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
