This pop release by Wham contains the song Last Christmas? Surprise!\r\n\r\nGeorge Michael, Was Not Was, and Wham. Quite a history for these folks. Saech them out to add to your library. Big Papi's Was Not Was is a rare upload and will die without your help : ) This CD is also not highly available. Please seed or we all bleed.\r\n\r\nLove and Peace for 2016\r\n\r\n- Big Papi\r\n\r\n[url=http://extraimago.com/image/HJU][img]http://extraimago.com/images/2016/01/05/Folder.md.jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia:\r\n[quote]Music from the Edge of Heaven is the third and final studio album from British pop duo Wham!, in 1986.\r\n\r\nThe album was only released in Japan and North America; in other territories, The Final was released instead. Both albums are related and have similar tracks, except The Final also contains all of the band's main singles and is more of a greatest hits album, while Music from the Edge of Heaven is commonly regarded as Wham!'s third studio album. Because it was not released in the UK, it was not included in the CD remastering series, though The Final was.\r\n\r\n&quot;The Edge of Heaven&quot;, &quot;Battlestations&quot;, &quot;Wham Rap '86&quot; and &quot;Where Did Your Heart Go?&quot;, according to the liner notes, are newly recorded for the album, with &quot;The Edge of Heaven&quot;, &quot;Battlestations&quot; and &quot;Where Did Your Heart Go?&quot; also appearing on The Final; the other half was slightly changed for the collection, with the exception of the Pudding Mix of &quot;Last Christmas&quot;:\r\n\r\n    The version of &quot;A Different Corner&quot; featured has an intro that does not appear elsewhere.\r\n    The version of &quot;I'm Your Man&quot; is slightly edited down from the Stimulation Mix and features a newly recorded spoken bridge.\r\n    This marks the only appearance of &quot;Blue&quot; (live in China) on CD.[/quote]\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n Wham! - Music from the Edge of Heaven\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nArtist...............: Wham!\r\nAlbum................: Music from the Edge of Heaven\r\nGenre................: Pop\r\nSource...............: CD\r\nYear.................: 1986\r\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\r\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\r\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\r\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 242kbps)\r\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n Tracklisting\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n 1.

It provides\r\nhigher dynamic range than 320kbps at a fraction of the file size.
