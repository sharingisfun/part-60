This two parter has been converted into a single movie and the scenes with just Travis Mayweather and his old girfriend/reporter Gannet Brooks have been removed. Deleting these 9 minutes of Travis does 2 things:\n1. improves the pacing of the show\n2. does not harm the main plot in any way since his romantic sub-plot is meaningless\n\nChanges:\n* Removed the breaks for commercials\n* Removed most fades before and after commercial breaks\n* Changed the opening music to the instrumental &quot;Archer's Theme&quot; instead of the original &quot;Faith of the Heart&quot; which has lyrics\n* Moved the s4e20 opening credits to the very start\n* Removed the s4e20 closing credits\n* Removed the s4e21 opening credits\n* Removed all of the one on one scenes with Ensign Travis Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery) and Gannet Brooks (Johanna Watts); 9m5s removed comprising 4 scenes from s4e20 and 2 scenes from s4e21. These scenes are not related to the main story. Brooks will appear on the ship at 26m12s as Archer and Reed come to Montgomery's quarters to take her into custody. The fanedit flows nicely without their scenes and this sub-plot.\n\nPlease check out other releases of Gotham, MST3K, Rifftrax, Battlestar Galactica, DC Comics, documentaries, Star Trek Enterprise and more at:\n  https://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/  \n  https://kat.cr/user/bsg4you/uploads/  \nand leave any corrections, criticism, comments and requests.\n\nThanks, bsg4you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a38da5683c79ec30b297cbd673f05893678d805","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+Enterprise+s4e20e21+FANEDIT+Movie+1080p+6ch+x265+HEVC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a38da5683c79ec30b297cbd673f05893678d805","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,56,218,86,131,199,158,195,11,41,124,189,103,63,5,137,54,120,216,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
