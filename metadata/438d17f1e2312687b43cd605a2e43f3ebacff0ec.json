Adguard removes all the annoying ads, blocks loading of dangerous websites, and will not allow anyone to track your activities on the Internet.\r\nWhen processing a web page, Adguard does several things at once:\r\n1. Removes ads and online tracking code directly from the page.\r\n2. Checks a page against our database of phishing and malicious sites.\r\n3. Checks apps downloaded from unknown sources.\r\n\r\nHTTPS filtering performance:\r\nOne more popular question was about download speed drop over HTTPs. HTTPs filtering is a heavy operation, so that was expected. What was unexpected to us is that some services like Google Play may download apps over HTTPs. So, we have greatly optimized the filtering speed. On our test device it has showed an increase in 5-10 times!\r\n\r\nCustom DNS servers:\r\nWith Adguard you can now override system DNS settings and use any DNS servers you like. Just as with proxy settings, Android does not allow you to do it when you are on mobile data, so Adguard is your only option. To do it: go to Settings â€“ Advanced â€“ Low-level settings â€“ tap pref.vpn.dns and enter preferred DNS servers addresses (one per line).\r\n\r\nUI\r\n[Added] Show warning when user tries to set notification icon to â€œNoneâ€:\r\n[Fixed] Tethering â€œconflictâ€ notification is shown every time:\r\n[Fixed] Statistics detalization for low-res devices:\r\n[Fixed] Dialog windows width:\r\n[Fixed] Accessibility problem for visually impaired users:\r\n\r\nNetworking\r\n[Added] Low level switch for AG to dump HTTP/HTTPS content to a file:\r\n[Fixed] Empty ad placeholders are visible in some apps with HTTPS filtering enabled:\r\n[Fixed] Adguard does not block connections when an app switches to SSL 3.0:\r\nFixed some apps repeat ad requests every second:\r\n[Fixed] HTTPS filtering does not work for Google domains (Android N):\r\n[Fixed] Error generating certificate for certificates w/o alternative name:\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n[Fixed] PrivatBank:\r\n[Fixed] Angry Birds Friends:\r\n[Fixed] HERE Maps:\r\n[Fixed] FarPost ÐšÐ¸Ð½Ð¾","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:438d17f1e2312687b43cd605a2e43f3ebacff0ec","amp;dn":"Adguard+Premium+Apk+%28Block+Ads+Without+Root%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"438d17f1e2312687b43cd605a2e43f3ebacff0ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,141,23,241,226,49,38,135,180,60,214,5,162,228,63,62,186,207,240,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
