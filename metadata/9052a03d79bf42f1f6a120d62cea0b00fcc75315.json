John Paizs\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088963/\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the best known and respected (albeit rarely seen) Canadian &quot;cult&quot; films, Crime Wave carries on in the unabashedly Canadian tradition of Goin' Down The Road, while providing the viewer with an experience entirely outside traditional mainstream Canadian film. Having one of the greatest debuts in English Canadian film history, Crime Wave announced the birth of a new genre in Canuck cinema: what cultural critic Geoff Pevere dubbed &quot;prairie postmodernism.&quot; A seminal film in Winnipeg independent film-making in the 1980's Crime Wave is a work of incredible imagination and inventive ideas. Upon its release the film played to terrific acclaim at film festivals across North America.\r\n\r\nCrammed with B movie gags and pop cultural references the movie follows the story of Steven Penny, a crime writer who wants to create the perfect colour crime movie, but he is only good at writing beginnings and endings, not the stuff in the middle. The movie is narrated by Kim, the little girl of a family that rents Steven a room above their garage. Steven teaches Kim different things about colour crime movies. He shows her his Bolex camera, explains why he only writes by streetlight, and plays her an audio tape which captured the sound of a camera that he borrowed from the NFB being run over by a car. In return, Kim tries to help Steven with making his movie.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 708x476, 23.976 fps, 1849 Kbps, 01h20m39s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 128 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/y8s4bbj5v/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/bmon3zlql/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/dfrjsb6x9/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/3jv26eqj1/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/v8hpdxdjh/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9052a03d79bf42f1f6a120d62cea0b00fcc75315","amp;dn":"Crime+Wave+%281985+-+Canada%29+Canuxploitation+cult+comedy+classic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9052a03d79bf42f1f6a120d62cea0b00fcc75315","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,82,160,61,121,191,66,241,246,161,32,214,44,234,11,0,252,199,83,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
