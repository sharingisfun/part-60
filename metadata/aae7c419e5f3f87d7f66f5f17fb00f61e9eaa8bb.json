As crops are already covering large parts of cultivable soils, is it is not conceivable to try to extend the cultures beyond the limit of available soils, but a further increase in productivity is not easy to obtain.\r\n\r\nThe book discusses advances in technology and plants design which support the exploitation and valorization of vegetable and fruit by-products through fermentation (feed-batch liquid fermentation, solid-state fermentation) in bio-based bio-chemicals/biofuels production. Pathways in the biosynthesis of fibers, sugars, and metabolites are provided with a focus on the lifecycle of bacteria, yeasts, and even plant species. The text analyzes cellular structures and the organization of cell walls in order to show which polysaccharides offer more favorable fermentative processes and which are detrimental.\r\n\r\n\r\nProvides an overview of all plant based biosources\r\nIncludes examples of biochemical/biofuel production from plant waste\r\nDiscusses the production of enzymes used in the plant fermentation processes\r\nExplores the new fermentation technologies and production of chemicals and fuels from various plants","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aae7c419e5f3f87d7f66f5f17fb00f61e9eaa8bb","amp;dn":"Biotransformation+of+Agricultural+Waste+and+By-Products","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aae7c419e5f3f87d7f66f5f17fb00f61e9eaa8bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,231,196,25,229,243,248,125,127,102,245,241,127,176,15,97,233,234,168,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
