In Sara Watkins' December 2007 MySpace blog, she said &quot;we're hoping to nearly (finish) the record in the next few days. We're tracking live and trying to get as much down at one time as possible. It is a very satisfying way to record&quot;.[4]\r\nTheir self-titled release debuted on August 28, 2009. Some of the tracks from the self-titled debut include the Phillips-penned tracks &quot;Rise Up&quot;, &quot;You Will Always Have My Love&quot;, and &quot;End This Now&quot;, as well as a Luke Bulla/Glen Phillips collaboration entitled &quot;Cry For You&quot;. &quot;Not Sure&quot;, one of three Sean Watkins track that is featured, was originally released on the Fiction Family album. The Works Progress Administration version features Luke Bulla giving a rich voice to the melody as well as the fuller orchestration.&quot; (Wikipedia)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18d9030cd31753d32b15a1fd1095e2f9b4be9146","amp;dn":"WPA+-+Works+Progress+Administration","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18d9030cd31753d32b15a1fd1095e2f9b4be9146","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,217,3,12,211,23,83,211,43,21,161,253,16,149,226,249,180,190,145,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
