Andrievski, A.V. Khatchoyan (Springer, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-3-319-25329-9\r\n\r\nThis book focuses on the behaviour of nanomaterials under extreme conditions of high temperature, irradiation by electron/ions and neutrons as well as in mechanical and corrosion extremes. The theoretical approaches and modeling are presented with numerous results of experimental studies. Different processing methods of extreme-tolerant nanomaterials are described. Many application examples from high-temperature technique, nuclear reactors of new generations, aerospace industry, chemical and general engineering, sensor facility, power engineering, electronics, catalysis and medical preparations are also contained. Some unresolved problems are emphasized","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5604b92d22340f45ac1f93278730cea3a660d28","amp;dn":"Nanomaterials+in+Extreme+Environments+-+Fundamentals+and+Applica","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5604b92d22340f45ac1f93278730cea3a660d28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,96,75,146,210,35,64,244,90,193,249,50,120,115,12,234,58,102,13,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
