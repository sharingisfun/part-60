Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nGuest: Nick DiPaolo\r\n\r\nEpisode 290: The first show of 2016 has Ant explaining his morning in court, â€œthe systemâ€ moving slowly, the evilness of social media, and Nick DiPaolo takes a seat to chat about the court system, waste of time employees, and his podcast. The guys then get into their holiday's, insane family, the Twilight Zone, creepy ass Wonderama, the documentary â€œRadio Unnameable,â€ totally annoying commercials, the pressure of having acceptance, â€œthe buildingâ€ of Donald Trump, election betting odds, and the Clintonâ€™s. Ant and Nick then talk about Jesse Ventura, â€œbeing the first,â€ James Caan and his cunty ex-wife, the movie â€œSicilian Vampire,â€ De Niroâ€™s ridiculous movie roles, and they watch a murderous moose video. They discuss stories regarding a vacation cruise, Air B&amp;B, the takeover in Oregon, and Montel Williams call for deadly force, they talk about people throwing around the word â€œterrorists,â€ the 2nd amendment, the reality of living in the â€œland of freedom,â€ De Blasio vs. Cuomo, and the down on their luck homeless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db018760714808333947e5e1bce56446847367e4","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2016-01-04+Nick+DiPaolo+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db018760714808333947e5e1bce56446847367e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,1,135,96,113,72,8,51,57,71,229,225,188,229,100,70,132,115,103,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
