It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Hunky Dory has been described by AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine as having &quot;a kaleidoscopic array of pop styles, tied together only by Bowie's sense of vision: a sweeping, cinematic mÃ©lange of high and low art, ambiguous sexuality, kitsch, and class&quot;.\r\n\r\nThe album has received critical acclaim since its release, and is regarded as one of the artist's best works. Time chose it as part of their &quot;100 best albums of all time&quot; list in January 2010, with journalist Josh Tyrangiel praising Bowie's &quot;earthbound ambition to be a boho poet with prodigal style&quot;. The style of the album cover was influenced by a Marlene Dietrich photo book that Bowie took with him to the photo shoot. (source: Wikipedia)\r\n\r\nRIP, David.
