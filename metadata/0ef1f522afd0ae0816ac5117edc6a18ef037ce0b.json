From now on, the refresh must be triggered manually.\r\n- Fixed: If Connections Log window is closed while performing a long running task, \r\nthe service does not abort the loading. This requires additional resources while \r\nthe window was already closed and there is no need for further processing.\r\n- Fixed: Connections Log window remains open if the service is stopped and the \r\nwindow was open.\r\n- Fixed: Notification dialog freezes in some scenarios if a program that is being \r\nblocked tries to reconnect hundreds of times per second but on different ports.\r\n- Fixed: After switching to editing mode in notification dialog, the ports and \r\nremote IP are updated automatically if the program retries to reconnect.\r\n- Fixed: Importing a full policy that was exported while High Filtering was enabled \r\nblocks WFC in High Filtering profile. Changing the profile does not help as the \r\nHigh Filtering profile is automatically switched back in a few seconds.\r\n- Fixed: Importing a full policy always switches the WFC profile to Low Filtering.\r\nThe profile is now unchanged after importing a full policy file.\r\n- Fixed: The rule name can contain leading or trailing white spaces when created \r\nfrom WFC, while from WFwAS this is not allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWindows Firewall Control - Managing Windows Firewall is now easier than ever\r\nProgram Overview\r\n\r\nWindows Firewall Control is a powerful application which extends the functionality of the Windows Firewall and provides quick access to the most frequent options of Windows Firewall. It runs in the system tray and allows user to control the native firewall easily without having to waste time by navigating to the specific part of the firewall. This is the best tool to manage the native firewall from Windows 10, 8.1, 8, 7, Vista, Server 2008, Server 2012. Windows Firewall Control offers four filtering modes which can be switched with just a mouse click:\r\n\r\nHigh Filtering - All outbound and inbound connections are blocked. This setting blocks all attempts to connect to and from your computer.\r\nMedium Filtering - Outbound connections that do not match a rule are blocked. Only the programs that you allow can initiate outbound connections.\r\nLow Filtering - Outbound connections that do not match a rule are allowed. The user can block the programs he doesn't want to allow initiating outbound connections.\r\nNo Filtering - Windows Firewall is turned off. Avoid using this setting unless you have another firewall running on your computer.\r\nProgram Features\r\n\r\nâˆš Intuitive and easy accessible interface in the system tray, next to the system clock.\r\nâˆš Full support with standard user accounts. Elevated privileges are required only at installation.\r\nâˆš Disable the ability of other programs to add Windows Firewall rules.\r\nâˆš Multiple and easier ways of creating new rules in Windows Firewall.\r\nâˆš Integrated support of creating, modifying and deleting Window Firewall rules.\r\nâˆš Lock feature which can disable the access to the settings of the program and Windows Firewall.\r\nâˆš Shell integration into the right click context menu of the executable files.\r\nâˆš Display invalid rules with the possibility to delete them very quickly.\r\nâˆš Merge multiple similar rules or duplicate existing ones.\r\nâˆš Search for executable files through folders and create new rules in seconds.\r\nâˆš View recently allowed and blocked connections and create new rules from the Security log.\r\nâˆš Choose if you want the program to start at user log on.\r\nâˆš Import, export and restore all firewall rules or just the selected rules.\r\nâˆš Protection to unauthorized uninstallation.\r\nâˆš Possibility to restore previous settings at uninstallation.\r\nâˆš Global hot keys are supported and various shortcut keys are available.\r\nâˆš And many, many more.
