It all started when Evan Fullmore was talking about making a band. Then all the sudden I was like you are making a rock band, why shouldnâ€™t I make a Cherry Landeaus? So to make pop music, we got Kyle Stersic writing songs and Lige Williamson on Performance Organ. We made a record and it was really good. Michle Saraugh made us make this video so we could play a party, but Evan, who was supposed to join the band, swept the gig out from under us so we had no party. This was the real beginning of the Fullmore/Landeaus feud.\r\n \nhttps:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b889f3631ad415bfabed93d489c9a1e482c8566d","amp;dn":"The+Cherry+Landeaus+-+Porn+Album+EP+-+%5Bmp3+320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b889f3631ad415bfabed93d489c9a1e482c8566d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,137,243,99,26,212,21,191,171,237,147,212,137,201,161,228,130,200,86,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
