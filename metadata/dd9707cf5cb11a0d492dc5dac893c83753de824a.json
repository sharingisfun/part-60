Arthur Waldron, University of Pennsylvania. Stephen Yates, Idaho GOP. Marcus Weisgerber, Defense One. Elbridge Colby, CNAS.\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€¦President Obama intends to end that streak with his visit on Friday, a decision that speaks volumes not only about his presidency but also about the increasingly worrisome struggle among powers great and small in East Asia.\r\n\r\nâ€œMr. Obamaâ€™s predecessors had good reasons to avoid Hiroshima. None wanted to be seen by American voters as apologizing for a decision that many historians even today believe, on balance, saved lives. And there were worries about how such a visit would be viewed in China, South Korea and other countries in Asia that suffered from the brutal World War II killing machine that was Imperial Japan.\r\n\r\nâ€œBut Mr. Obama and his closest aides have become increasingly disdainful of what they view as Washingtonâ€™s conventional wisdom.\r\n\r\nâ€œNo American president had visited Cuba in nearly 90 years. Mr. Obama did. None had visited Myanmar. He has gone twice. Few saw merit in negotiating with Iranâ€™s autocratic mullahs. Mr. Obama struck a nuclear deal with the Iranians that he ranks among his greatest accomplishments. And in Vietnam this week, he lifted a decades-old embargo on military sales.\r\n\r\nâ€œMr. Obama has made clear that he will not apologize for the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but with no election left for himself, he cares far less about opponents who have caricatured as an â€œapology tourâ€ of foreign cities.â€¦.â€\r\n \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/world/asia/obama-hiroshima-visit.html\r\n \nhttp://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/22/china-pressures-taiwans-president-tsai-ing-wen-to-acknowledge-one-china.html\r\n \nhttp://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201605240043.html\r\n \nhttp://www.defenseone.com/management/2016/05/carter-expect-mil-mil-cooperation-between-us-vietnam/128515/?oref=d-river\r\n \nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-ambiguity-on-taiwan-is-dangerous-1464022837.\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show\t\r\n \nhttp://johnbatchelorshow.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd9707cf5cb11a0d492dc5dac893c83753de824a","amp;dn":"Obama+not+an+Apology+Tour+John+Batchelor.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd9707cf5cb11a0d492dc5dac893c83753de824a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,151,7,207,92,177,26,13,73,45,197,218,200,147,200,55,83,222,130,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
