Heâ€™s a former U.S. Navy SEAL with extensive experience in espionage. Working for a private intelligence company, he will provide the CIA, and more important, the President, with absolute deniability.\r\n\r\nBut deep within the Russian Caucasus, Moscow also has its own special kind of operative. As a child, Sacha Baseyev endured an unimaginable horror. Today, he lives and breathes for only one reasonâ€”to kill. And he will kill as many Americans as it takes to accomplish his mission.\r\n\r\nWhen a clandestine American operations team is ambushed near Syria, all signs point toward a dangerous informant in Brussels. But as Harvath searches for the man, he uncovers another actorâ€”a rogue player hell-bent on forcing Americaâ€™s hand and drawing it into a confrontation deadlier than anyone could have imagined.\r\n\r\nAs the attacks mount, and terror is brought to the very doorstep of the White House, Harvath finds himself in the race of his life. From Vienna, Brussels, and Berlin, to Malta, Jordan, and Syriaâ€”he will push himself beyond the edge in order to confront one of the greatest evils the world has ever known.\r\n\r\nFilled with action, intrigue, and edge-of-your-seat suspense, Foreign Agent is a nonstop thrill ride that reaffirms Thorâ€™s position as the â€œmaster of thrillers.â€","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:349faafec77f9a9e8fed87a4be1b027f287d4af4","amp;dn":"The+Problem+with+Forever+%28Harlequin+Teen%29+-+%7BCHB+Books%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"349faafec77f9a9e8fed87a4be1b027f287d4af4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,159,170,254,199,127,154,158,143,237,135,164,190,27,2,127,40,125,74,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
