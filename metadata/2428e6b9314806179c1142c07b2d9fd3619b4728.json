Stylistically, the record is a haphazard but browsable display of some of Agnew's favorite musical trinkets and knickknacks, a collection of odds and ends that is a patchwork of old and new material, borrowed songs and originals. Thematically, the album is devoted largely to expelling rancid, undigested emotional material left over from failed relationships and betrayed friendships. Hence the blunt title.\r\nOn &quot;Emotional Vomit,&quot; Agnew again plays most of the music, including drums, bass, guitars, vocals and keyboards, but it's not strictly a solo affair like &quot;All By Myself&quot; (that first solo album is now available again, packaged by Frontier Records on CD with the first Adolescents LP). Among those helping out on the new album are younger brothers Alfie and Frank Agnew. \r\nWith its collection of reworked tunes by obscure Orange County bands such as the Mechanics and L.S.D., covers of songs by Depeche Mode and T-Rex, and originals that range from a Phil Spector-style big romantic ballad to &quot;Stress (I Go),&quot; a funny, blitzing speed-metal-tinged rant about coping with everyday frustrations, Agnew's Yard Sale project collects odds and ends, suggesting great versatility, but not setting a cohesive career direction.
