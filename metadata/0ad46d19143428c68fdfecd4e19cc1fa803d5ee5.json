He tells Porter about some Asian couriers who carry $300,000, \r\nPorter agrees to it on the condition that they split the take. When they hit \r\nthem, they discover that they only have $140,000, and Resnick says that, \r\nthat's what they always carry. He pulls out a gun and shoots Porter in the \r\nback and leaves him to die. However, Porter manages to make it to a doctor, \r\nand get treated, when he recovers, he sets out to get Resnick and his share \r\n$70,000. He begins by approaching an associate of Resnick's. Porter then \r\nseeks out a prostitute named Rosie, whom he knew, she tells him where he \r\ncan find Resnick, when he does he tells Resnick that he should go to his \r\nemployers and ask them to give him back $70,000 of the money he gave them, \r\nResnick says that's impossible but Porter &quot;convinces&quot; him to do it. Resnick \r\nthen goes to his boss, Mr. Carter, who tells him that it's in their best \r\ninterest to help Resnick deal with Porter. Carter orders one of his men to \r\ntake Porter out but Porter's just too good for them. Resnick then asks his \r\ngirlfriend who knows the people whom he and Porter stole the money from, \r\nand tells her to tell them where they can find him. When they do they are \r\ninterrupted by two policemen, but they are crooked who are under the \r\nimpression that Porter's going after $200,000-300,000 and are going to \r\nget it. Can Porter deal with all these people and still get his money.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Mel Gibson.\r\n=&gt;-Gregg Henry.\r\n=&gt;-Maria Bello.\r\n=&gt;-Kris Kristofferson.\r\n=&gt;-Lucy Liu.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Brian Helgeland.\r\n\r\nPayback Straight Up D.C 2006.\r\nThe Director's Cut (dubbed Payback: Straight Up) has a largely similar \r\nfoundation but explores the betrayal of Porter through flashbacks and most \r\nsignificantly removes the Bronson character from the screen. Instead a \r\nfemale voice (belonging to Sally Kellerman) on the telephone replaces Kris \r\nKristofferson. The scene with the booby-trapped telephone is eliminated, \r\nas is the kidnapping of Bronson's son. In this version, Val kills Rosie's \r\ndog Porter. The simplified story line ends with Porter collecting his money \r\nat an arranged drop in a train station where he has several shoot outs with \r\nsyndicate hit-men staking out the station. He is seriously wounded and \r\nseemingly near death before being driven away by Rosie with the money. \r\nThe Director's Cut also lacks the theatrical version's voice-over \r\nnarration by Porter.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Mel Gibson.\r\n=&gt;-Gregg Henry.\r\n=&gt;-Maria Bello.\r\n=&gt;-Kris Kristofferson.\r\n=&gt;-Lucy Liu.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Brian Helgeland.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Action : Crime : Drama.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1999 : 2006.\r\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\r\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.17 GiB : 1.04 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 660 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 41mn : 1h 30mn.\r\n=&gt;-Chapters...................: 18 Named : 14 Named.\r\n=&gt;-Payback 1999...............: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1087648-payback/\r\n=&gt;-Payback Straight Up 2006...: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0958860/\r\n=&gt;-Payback Straight Up 2006...: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/payback-straight-up---the-directors-cut/\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.35:1 : 2.40:1.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 544 : 1280 x 528.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1 543 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 174 Kbps.\r\n\r\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ad46d19143428c68fdfecd4e19cc1fa803d5ee5","amp;dn":"Payback+And+Payback+Straight+Up+DC+-+Mel+Gibson+1999+2006+Eng+Su","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ad46d19143428c68fdfecd4e19cc1fa803d5ee5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,212,109,25,20,52,40,198,143,223,236,212,225,156,193,250,128,61,94,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
