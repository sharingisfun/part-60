Shortly afterward, the three associates are killed by Thor (Ray Corrigan, in his for-rent ape suit), a huge ape trained by Ernst, and Arnold, his daughter Babs and Ken Morgan, a representative of the company for whom the robot was made, find it has been stolen. Their 15-chapter search for Thor, the robot and Ernst leads to a series of cliff-hanging adventures as Ernst strives to gain control of the robot and the supply of metalogen needed for its production. \r\n\r\nYeah, it's pretty bad but interesting for knowing what used to happen.\r\n\r\nPlease SEED and remember to tip your waiter","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e66508cdefa3b99cf3e761ce350e1f45ccde8f9","amp;dn":"The+Monster+and+the+Ape+%28a.k.a.+The+Metalogen+Man%29+OTS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e66508cdefa3b99cf3e761ce350e1f45ccde8f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,102,80,140,222,250,59,153,207,62,118,28,227,80,225,244,92,205,232,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
