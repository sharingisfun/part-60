Oh, erâ€¦ well, our music is simply inspired by the current speech, the sad and self-indulging failure-loving speech proudly defended by the &quot;cool&quot; people of our &quot;cool&quot; generationâ€¦&quot;\r\n\r\nBitrate: ~1100kBit/s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6010d7c4e2e96319695e3ee1e147b968d2a78656","amp;dn":"Nine+Eleven+-+Use+Your+Disillusion+%282007%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6010d7c4e2e96319695e3ee1e147b968d2a78656","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,16,215,196,226,233,99,25,105,94,62,225,225,71,185,104,210,167,134,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
