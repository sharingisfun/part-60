New features added below, feel free to check it out!\r\n\r\nThe year -- sometime in the future. The world as we knew it has crumbled and descended into chaos. Crime of all types is rampant and committed openly. Police and other vital services are stretched to the limit.\r\n\r\nYour time is now.\r\n\r\nLoosely inspired by the classic strategy PC game Chaos Overlords, Streets of Chaos is a unique strategy/board game hybrid where you become the leader of a rising resistance in a world gripped by crime and anarchy. Your very simple goal: to take over the city and run it -- your way. Your obstacles: the police, the judges and one other rebel leader who, like you, sees this broken city as his for the taking","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8fe1419e87c850ca3a8fd0b5206f3f296e4d0d1","amp;dn":"Streets+of+Chaos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8fe1419e87c850ca3a8fd0b5206f3f296e4d0d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,254,20,25,232,124,133,12,163,168,253,11,82,6,243,242,150,228,208,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
