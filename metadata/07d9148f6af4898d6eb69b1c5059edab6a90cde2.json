The group really take to yoga, learn some Hindi and take advantage of the cheap and impressive medical care. After undergoing some tests, both Miriam and Rosemary hear some news they didn't want to hear but needed to know.\r\n\r\nTheir first big night out is to the swanky Paladio, popular with local ex-pats, where Wayne finds out about attitudes to gay people in India and Jan discovers how easy it would be for her as a single woman to move out here.\r\n\r\nTo round their second week off, the group test out long-distance travel by taking a 150-mile trip to the jewel in India's crown, the Taj Mahal. Miriam, Rosemary and Wayne make the most of travelling by train, an unforgettable experience, while Roy, Patti and Jan take the chauffeur-driven car option.\r\n\r\nThe Taj Mahal, the world's most impressive monument to love, makes the group reflective and its sheer beauty brings Miriam to tears.\r\n\r\nFormat                         : Matroska\r\nFile size                      : 1 018 MiB\r\nDuration                       : 59mn 22s\r\nOverall bit rate mode          : Variable\r\nOverall bit rate               : 2 398 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat                         : AVC\r\nBit rate mode                  : Variable\r\nMaximum bit rate               : 3 500 Kbps\r\nWidth                          : 1 280 pixels\r\nHeight                         : 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio           : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode                : Constant\r\nFrame rate                     : 25.000 fps\r\nColor space                    : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling             : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth                      : 8 bits\r\nScan type                      : Progressive\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nFormat                         : AAC\r\nChannel(s)                     : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions              : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate                  : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode               : Lossy\r\nLanguage                       : English\r\n\r\nText\r\nLanguage                       : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07d9148f6af4898d6eb69b1c5059edab6a90cde2","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Real+Marigold+Hotel+Episode+2of3+720p+x264+HEVCguy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07d9148f6af4898d6eb69b1c5059edab6a90cde2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,217,20,143,106,244,137,141,110,182,155,28,80,89,237,171,106,144,205,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
