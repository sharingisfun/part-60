The initial\r\nrelease had 27 glitchy frames (at 1:51:11) due to a bad source. It must have been\r\nthe same source that BLOW used,  as it was later removed from the private torrent\r\ntracker I got it from. Conclusion: BLOW uses sources from p2p. Haha, busted!\r\n\r\nI could have just made another rip from a good source, but I can't expect people\r\nto download the entire release again.  So, I bring you this tiny patch that will\r\nactually replace the glitchy frames and give you a flawless release, without the\r\nneed to download the entire file again. Like I've said: This has never been done\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nHow to Apply\r\n1.) Download the actual release\r\n2.) Move all the files from this torrent to the same folder\r\n    where the .mkv file is located\r\n3.) Run the batch file (fix-the.martian-nezu.bat)\r\n4.) Follow the on-screen instructions.\r\n5.) You're done. Now enjoy. And have a happy New Year!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e73eb7e1a23adbbae74def73f954f1414773fcd9","amp;dn":"The.Martian.2015.FiX.720p.BluRay.x264-NeZu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e73eb7e1a23adbbae74def73f954f1414773fcd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,62,183,225,162,58,219,186,231,77,239,115,249,84,241,65,71,115,252,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
