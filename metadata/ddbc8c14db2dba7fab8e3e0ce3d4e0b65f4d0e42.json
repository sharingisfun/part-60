It's unthinkable, the stuff of nightmares. But when she turns her back to pay a parking meter, Carrie Morgan becomes that mother. Ben is gone, and more than a year later, it's clear that he is never coming back.\r\nUntil he does...for just twenty-four hours, before once again vanishing from his crib without a trace. Rumors start to circulate through Carrie's small town. Whispers that she's seeing things. That her alibi doesn't quite add up.\r\nHer husband and friends start to think she's crazy. The police start to think she's guilty. As the investigation heats up, Carrie must decide what to share, and why. Because the crime is about to be solved... and her secret revealed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddbc8c14db2dba7fab8e3e0ce3d4e0b65f4d0e42","amp;dn":"One+More+Day+-+%7BCHB+Books%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddbc8c14db2dba7fab8e3e0ce3d4e0b65f4d0e42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,188,140,20,219,45,186,127,171,142,62,12,227,212,224,182,95,77,14,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
