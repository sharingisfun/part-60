This was in the 30s, 40s and 50s.  They finally died out as the price became too high to justify this &quot;freeby&quot; being offered by theater owners.\r\n\r\nI have a bunch of these.  If they prove to be popular (many seeds), I will continue to upload so don't just download and delete, SEED THESE YOURSELF to speed propagation and lower my data rate.  \r\n\r\nWithout that help, I am limited in what I can seed because of limited bandwidth.  This cannot be done without additional seeders.  More seeders = more variety &amp; faster uploads.\r\n\r\nSo if you like it, SEED IT!  That way, others can like it too","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:055a12d1172a353fc20f7117080ffd924f7bf2ff","amp;dn":"Ace+Drummond+Old+Time+Serial+%28OTS%29+%281936%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"055a12d1172a353fc20f7117080ffd924f7bf2ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,90,18,209,23,42,53,63,194,15,113,23,8,15,253,146,79,123,242,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
