This band is like your friendâ€™s band; you went and saw them play in a bar with another mateâ€™s band, had a drunken headbang.\r\nThe sound is very familiar, Iâ€™d call the genre solid rock. \r\n\r\nI saw them live. Flavoured with a  hint of PRIEST and LAMB OF GOD seasoning.\r\nThese guys are a band made for the road and tour, tour, tour, Get the experiences and all will be good.\r\nThey do offer variety in the styles of the tracks, and the album on the whole doesnâ€™t sound repetitive. Much of this is due to Michael Schtiffmanâ€™s changing vocal approach.\r\n\r\nIn short, â€œReign of Reptilesâ€ by ROCKY LEWIS is a grassroots sounding rock album with nods to other genres. Itâ€™s the kind of album you will appreciate more if there is a great context attached to hearing it. \r\n \r\nDefinitely a band to keep an ear out for. \r\n\r\nTotal length : 0:43:29\r\n\r\n10 tracks\r\n\r\nGenre: Rock  \r\n\r\n1 Burning to Burn You\r\n    00:03:43  \r\n2 London Is Burning\r\n    00:03:47\r\n3 Soulghetto\r\n    00:04:57 \r\n4 Parasites\r\n    00:04:08 \r\n5 Watch the World Die\r\n    00:06:23  \r\n6 Double Jeopardy\r\n    00:03:15  \r\n7 Never Know\r\n    00:03:42 \r\n8 Friendly Fire\r\n    00:02:38 \r\n9 In Another Life\r\n    00:04:23    \r\n10 Reigned by Reptiles\r\n     0:06:33 \r\n\r\nLineup:\r\n\r\nMichael Schtiffman â€“ Guitar, Vocals\r\nMartin Matyssek â€“ Drums\r\nAndrÃ© Ruppert â€“ Bass","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1c81f0f80a19d5340fb34780b1059d38eee9faa","amp;dn":"Rocky+Lewis+-+Reign+Of+Reptiles+%282015%29320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1c81f0f80a19d5340fb34780b1059d38eee9faa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,200,31,15,128,161,157,83,64,251,52,120,11,16,89,211,142,238,159,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
