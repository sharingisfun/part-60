No indulgence has been ignored, no detail overlooked. But all the money in the world canâ€™t guarantee safety. As hotel manager Tessa and her employees ready the hotel for its invitation-only grand opening, a killer is in their midst. One by one, staff are picked off with ruthless precision. And before the night is over, as Tessa desperately struggles to survive, it will become clear that the strangest and most terrible truth at Manderley is simply this: someone is watching.\r\n\r\nWith stunning ingenuity, Gina Wohlsdorf puts readers front and center as the elite resort becomes a house of horrors. Riveting to the final sentence, Security is fierce, wry, and impossible to put down. With a deep bow to the literary tradition of Stephen King, Edgar Allan Poe, and Daphne du Maurier, Wohlsdorfâ€™s razor-wire prose blitzes readers with quick twists, sharp turns, and gasp-inducing terror. Security is at once a shocking thriller, a brilliant narrative puzzle, and a moving, multifaceted love story unlike any other","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f5914c3ed7017d3c91c1500783700a03e0ad689","amp;dn":"Security+-+Gina+Wohlsdorf+-+%7BCHB+Books%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f5914c3ed7017d3c91c1500783700a03e0ad689","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,89,20,195,237,112,23,211,201,28,21,0,120,55,0,160,62,10,214,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
