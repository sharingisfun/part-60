Other adventurers have strayed too far off the beaten track and found themselves hostage to guerrilla forces. Follow these individuals as they find themselves falling deeper into an inescapable downward spiral, from their initial motivation for the trip to their moment of arrest. Their capture, navigation of an incomprehensible legal system, time in incarceration and the traumatic blow the experience has on their relationships with family and friends are all profiled in this eye-opening series.\r\n\r\nEp 1 - Istanbul\r\nEp 2 - Iraq\r\nEp 3 - Tokyo\r\nEp 4 - Bangkok\r\nEp 5 - Spain\r\nEp 6 - Panama","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccf3a4c0fa94ede1450b13244b61ec3cf2cb482e","amp;dn":"Banged+Up+Abroad+-+Season+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccf3a4c0fa94ede1450b13244b61ec3cf2cb482e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,243,164,192,250,148,237,225,69,11,19,36,75,97,236,60,242,203,72,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
