The answer? Invite them in and make a show of it! Enter, the Dungeon League.\r\n\r\nThe Dungeon Masters have a new favourite sport, Dungeon League takes everything that is awesome about dungeon crawling and spews it out as 10 minutes of chaotic, multiplayer, party-game action. Up to four All Stars take to the procedurally generated dungeon to battle each other (and hordes of enemies) in a series of two minute rounds pulled at random from a stack of wildly different Quests. From the classic Deathmatch to the ever frantic (and kind of gross) Witches Eye, each round is hard fought and requires unique tactics to succeed.\r\n\r\nTeaming up or standing only for themselves, each of the classic RPG heroes will rapidly level up and equip new gear between rounds, going from zero to hero in minutes not hours","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfd275da5a18476d0807613faed0ffc8eced703c","amp;dn":"Dungeon+League+%28Early+Access%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfd275da5a18476d0807613faed0ffc8eced703c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,210,117,218,90,24,71,109,8,7,97,63,174,208,255,200,236,237,112,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
