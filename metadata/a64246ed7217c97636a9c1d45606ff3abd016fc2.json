Acorn is a unique, colourful and shapeless icon pack.\r\n\r\nIt's still in beta so there's just 250 icons at the moment, but there's plenty more to come. So please do be patient. There's also 8 awesome wallpapers to make your setups look awesome ;)\r\n\r\nAlso, remember to use the icon request tool to send in your un-themed icons. The waiting time at the moment is just 1 week!\r\n\r\nMy future plans for acorn include\r\n\r\n- A new app icon\r\n- Get to 800 icons by July\r\n- Dashboard tweaks/fixes\r\n\r\nMore info:\r\n \nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skykonig.acornicons","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a64246ed7217c97636a9c1d45606ff3abd016fc2","amp;dn":"Acorn+Icons+BETA+v1.0.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a64246ed7217c97636a9c1d45606ff3abd016fc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,66,70,237,114,23,201,118,54,169,193,212,86,6,255,58,189,1,111,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
