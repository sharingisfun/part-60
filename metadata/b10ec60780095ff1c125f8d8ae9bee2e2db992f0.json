Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nGuests: Reverend Bob Levy, Jackie Martling, John Melendez, Steve Grillo, KC Armstrong\r\n\r\nEpisode 286: Hold on to your hats guys, the new TACS desk is (finally) here with Howard Stern alongside Reverend Bob Levy, Jackie Martling, John Melendez, Steve Grillo, and KC. After Howie makes his exit, the guys give Ant a little dating advice, they chat about their younger bodies, virtual porn, relationships, Johnâ€™s shitty driving, and laugh about radio blowouts, staff drama, banned guests, and KC almost bleeding out. They touch on behind the scenes antics, kicking drugs, making music, competition, company men, station cheapness, firings, heckling, raging hard-ons, Johnâ€™s son, Damone, and late night TV. We hear about Bobâ€™s sonâ€™s band, the guys bring up shit gigs and life before social media, fucking with the wrong people, â€œPeople V OJ Simpsonâ€ on FX, the old days of Stern radio, pranks gone wrong, Jessica Hahn, Dominic Barbara, and dead guests. We watch a cremation video, KC tells us about his new gig, they bust each otherâ€™s balls while telling stories about Johnâ€™s wedding and weight loss contests, they also talk about Artie Lange, Gilbert Gottfried, Dice on Ice, Joey Adams, Pat Cooper, hair plugs, and laminates.\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b10ec60780095ff1c125f8d8ae9bee2e2db992f0","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-12-22+Howard+Stern+Reunion+Show+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b10ec60780095ff1c125f8d8ae9bee2e2db992f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,14,198,7,128,9,95,241,193,37,248,216,174,155,238,46,45,185,146,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
