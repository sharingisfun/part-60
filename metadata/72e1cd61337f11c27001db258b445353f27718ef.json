He also happens to be Aryan's lookalike. Gaurav goes to Mumbai to meet his idol but is denied entry. Angered by the behaviour meted out to him Gaurav goes berrserk. He decides to become Aryan's nemesis following him everywhere from London to Dubrovinik and back to India. He commits crime after crime and the blame falls on Aryan. It starts affecting Aryan's career and his standing on the popularity charts. How Aryan overcomes his obsessive Fan is the story of this film..\r\n\r\nComments:\r\nAn interesting, if completely improbable story about a fan who goes berserk after being denied an audience with his idol. His fascination continues but he now is hell bent on destroying the man he once adored. Sharukh does a fine job in a double role and the trick photography is superb. Some slick editing helps.\r\n\r\nOverall a slick film that will hold you at the edge of your seat as drama after drama unfolds, until the very end.\r\n\r\nUploader's Notes:\r\nA very good quality DVD with some minor flaws. We have done a bit of luma correction to bring out details in scenes and a slight correction for a faint yellow tint. The result is a rip that we hope will be pleasing to your eyes..\r\n\r\nThe 10-bit compressibility and the magic of x265, allowed us to compress the video to just 700 MB and yet maintain full quality. We will not be doing an upscale as the Blu ray will be out even as we upload this.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this rip (and all HEVC rips) will not play on most stand-alone devices. You can only watch this on a computer or a compatible device. On your computer be sure that you have the latest versions of VLC (2.1.5 or higher) or Media Player Classic (Ver 1.7.9) or SMPlayer (14.9.0). Earlier versions may not work\r\n\r\nIMDB Link: \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt3495026/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72e1cd61337f11c27001db258b445353f27718ef","amp;dn":"FAN+%282016%29+-+DVD+Rip+-+HEVC+-+x265.AAC.Esubs+-+1CD+-+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72e1cd61337f11c27001db258b445353f27718ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,225,205,97,51,127,17,194,112,1,219,37,139,68,83,83,242,119,24,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
