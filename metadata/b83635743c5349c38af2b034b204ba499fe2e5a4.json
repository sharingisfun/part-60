To the game designer, Hell is the game.\r\n\r\nDamico writes games for a living. When called in to rescue a local roleplaying game demo, Damico is shot in the head by a loony fan. He awakens in a game. A game full of hackneyed tropes and clichÃ©d plots. A game he was there to save, run by the man who murdered him just moments ago. A game that has just become world-swap fantasy. Damico, to his horror, has become the heart of the clichÃ©.\r\n\r\nSet on their quest in a scene that would make Ed Wood blush, Damico discovers a new wrinkle. As a game designer, he is a creative force in this broken place. His presence touches the two-dimensional inhabitants. First a peasant, then a barmaid, then his characterâ€™s own fatherâ€¦all come alive.\r\n\r\nBut the central question remains. Can Damico escape, or is he trapped in this nightmare? Forever.\r\n\r\nWait, what? This is a comedy? Ignore all that. Death by ClichÃ© is a heartwarming tale of catastrophic brain damage. Share it with someone you love. Or like. Or anyone at all. \r\n\r\n                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\n                          Visit us for more Awesome ebooks             \r\n\r\n                               http://booksdeity.com/\r\n \r\n                         **********************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b83635743c5349c38af2b034b204ba499fe2e5a4","amp;dn":"Death+by+Clich%26eacute%3B+by+Bob+Defendi.epub+%2A%7BBooksDeity%7D%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b83635743c5349c38af2b034b204ba499fe2e5a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,54,53,116,60,83,73,195,138,242,176,52,178,4,186,73,159,226,229,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
