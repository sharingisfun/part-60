The program recounts the final days before the execution of Edward Earl Johnson, an American prisoner convicted of rape and murder. Johnson protested his innocence and claimed that his confession had been made under duress. He was executed in Mississippi's gas chamber on May 20, 1987.\r\n\r\nThe documentary crew, given access to the prison warden, guards and chaplain and to Johnson and his family, filmed the last days of Johnson's life in detail. The documentary argues against the death penalty and maintains that capital punishment is disproportionately applied to African-Americans convicted of crimes against whites. The program features attorney Clive Stafford Smith, a noted advocate against capital punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI remember watching this when I was a lot younger, I found it very moving. I have been after this for a while and managed to get it but its split into two parts. \r\n\r\nIf you enjoy please seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b564059a1e0a1cb4ba1872348787944c4e99eacd","amp;dn":"Fourteen+Days+in+May+Death+Row+Documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b564059a1e0a1cb4ba1872348787944c4e99eacd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,100,5,154,30,10,28,180,186,24,114,52,135,135,148,76,78,153,234,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
