The second story focuses on retired GP Clive Probert and his wife, Norma. Their catamaran holiday around the Greek islands turns into a nightmare when a freak storm overturns their boat. After Clive falls into the sea and Norma is trapped inside a tiny air pocket underneath the vessel, ex-pat Irishman Ruairi Bradley attempts to save them both.\r\n\r\n2)  Part 2 \r\nRecreating the moment nurse Dan Ward was swept into the sea by a freak wave while kayaking on the Welsh coast, and the actions of surfer Steve Lewis, who attempted to find him. The second story centres on Peter Langdown, who was impaled by a fence post after he and his cousin crashed into a ditch. Retired Engineer Neville Powell and his wife Gloria happened upon the car accident, eventually joined by insurance manager Tim Slater. As petrol poured close to electrical sparks, Neville and Tim had to work fast to rescue the occupants before a potential explosion.\r\n\r\n3)  Part 3 \r\nThe stories of two car accidents which took place at night, beginning with the experience of 18-year-old care worker Dannie Phillips, whose vehicle veered off the road in Cornwall on Christmas Eve 2012 and started sinking in a murky quagmire. The second case features a family of four on their way to a holiday in Devon, who suffered a nightmare scenario when a tyre blowout left their car in the central reservation of the M5 and at the mercy of oncoming traffic on the carriageway.\r\n\r\n4)  Part 4 \r\nThe series concludes with the story of a gunman who opened fire on nuclear submarine HMS Astute docked at Southampton in 2011, and how two civilians managed to disarm him, before noticing that he was wearing what appeared to be a bomb vest. Plus, how a group of English teenage cadets aided injured fellow climbers in the French Pyrenees, deciding whether to risk their own lives by climbing to the trapped group high above them on the mountain.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/79/Saved-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b7/Saved-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6a/Saved-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/97/Saved-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4d/Saved-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b1/Saved-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/53/Saved-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bc/Saved-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7a/Saved-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4d/Saved-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/23/Saved-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a7/Saved-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3137 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 47mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 4\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.02 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/programme/dx5mdm/saved","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb1ca38950f719605405051e0c847ecacdb3a73e","amp;dn":"ITV+Saved+Series+1+4of4+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb1ca38950f719605405051e0c847ecacdb3a73e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,28,163,137,80,247,25,96,84,5,5,30,12,132,126,202,205,179,167,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
