However, these alloys can suffer SCC under certain conditions, resulting in component failure. A key figure in understanding the mechanisms of SCC in nickel alloys in water-cooled nuclear reactors is Henri Coriou of the CEA, Franceâ€™s leading center for nuclear research. This book assesses his work in the context of the latest research on SCC in nickel alloys in nuclear power plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nUp-to-date reviews of recent research findings from leading experts in the field\r\nAuthoritative and comprehensively reviewed by the Working Party 4 on Nuclear Corrosion\r\nShowcases the excellent quality and technical accomplishments of Henri Coriou and CEA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67f3da7a69b22fac99d50839e0e2c3fd7780b4be","amp;dn":"Stress+Corrosion+Cracking+of+Nickel-based+Alloys+in+Water-cooled","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67f3da7a69b22fac99d50839e0e2c3fd7780b4be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,243,218,122,105,178,47,172,153,213,8,57,224,226,195,253,119,128,180,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
