Cradit comes The Illusions of Eventide. This novel is Volume 1 in the bestselling witches family saga, The House of Crimson &amp; Clover, and the recommended starting point for new readers.\r\n\r\nNicolas Deschanel was betrayed by the only two people who matter to him. Their disloyalty stung and an overwhelming sense of loss lingers. Nicolas has lived the high life professing to not have a care in the world, and now this illusion is calling his bluff. \r\n\r\nDetermined to take control of an existence now devoid of purpose, he sojourns to his family's holiday home on the Gulf of Mexico. Resolved more than depressed, he plans to privately say goodbye to a world which no longer needs him. Of questionable fortune, he finds a woman, Mercy, sitting alone on the shore at eventide. Nicolas is conflicted between an obligation to help, and annoyance at her intrusion. \r\n\r\nMercy has many layers of secrets. Deepest of all, she cannot tell this Child of Man she is thousands of years old and very powerful. In her presence, Nicolasâ€™ own dormant powers begin to surface, triggering a sequence of events that cause both of their lives to spiral further out of control. When old friends from both sides come to help, together they all learn a painful truth: new life can only begin once youâ€™ve set free what means the most.\r\n \r\n..[/color][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://s10.postimg.org/l1kh8y3gp/cooltext1925887515.gif[/img][/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56e2a28397640b16984acced805202bdcbf2ba10","amp;dn":"The+Illusions+of+Eventide+By+Sarah+M.+Cradit+%5BEpub%5D+%5BDTW%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56e2a28397640b16984acced805202bdcbf2ba10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,226,162,131,151,100,11,22,152,74,204,237,128,82,2,189,203,242,186,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
