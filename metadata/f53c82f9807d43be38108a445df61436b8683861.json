It combines Greek Mythology with Sci-Fi in a twisted way! This remake is fully animated with 60FPS, silly vector FHD graphics and super silly dialogs.\r\n\r\nYou control Zeus (Boss of Olympus) which is a wacky character. He tries to fix a time machine to save the planet from explosion. Everything happens in Greek mythology timeframe. The characters and dialogues are silly and translated into 6 languages. There is English Voice over in some cut scenes. Everything is fully animated with 60fps. We use Vector art, a unique cartoonish style.\r\n\r\nZeus, the boss of Olympus is summoned back to earth by an ancient security mechanism. The story starts with Zeus flying his spaceship and landing it in the bottom of the Santorini Ocean. In Santorini he will interact with dozens of crazy characters and solve many smart puzzles. \r\n\r\nThe game is big, full length. He will visit Oia, Akrotiri, Fira, Caldera, Volcano and many more places until he finally discovers his super weapon, the thunder and the time machine box. But even then the task is far from over, he will have to set sail to another cluster of Greek islands, Milos, Karpathos, Mykonos and Delos. \r\n\r\nThere he has to find the scattered pieces of the time machine so that he can use it to save the planet. There he will even abduct Europe transformed into a bull (mythology) and take her to Minoan Crete in the Knossos timeframe. There he will enter the famous labyrinth of Knossos, go to Festos and find the missing pieces to complete the mission.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Silly 'Point and Click' Adventure game, Old-School.\r\nâ€¢ Silly 60FPS fully animated characters.\r\nâ€¢ Silly plot &amp; dialogues translated into 6 languages.\r\nâ€¢ Silly vector graphics in Full HD.\r\n* Saves / loads progress from cloud to switch devices\r\n* Getting started help - Tips system.\r\n\r\nWhat's New:\r\n\r\n* Zeus Animation issues fixed\r\n* Zeus moves his head now normally.\r\n* Zeus animation is normal now.\r\n* links fixed\r\n* bug fixes.\r\n\r\nMore Info:\r\n \nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crazysoft.zeusquestremastered\r\n\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n\r\n1.Copy 'com.crazysoft.zeusquestremastered' folder to 'sdcard/Android/obb'\r\n2.Install APK\r\n3.Launch the game","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f53c82f9807d43be38108a445df61436b8683861","amp;dn":"Zeus+Quest+Remastered+v1.0.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f53c82f9807d43be38108a445df61436b8683861","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,60,130,249,128,125,67,190,56,16,138,68,93,246,20,54,184,104,56,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
