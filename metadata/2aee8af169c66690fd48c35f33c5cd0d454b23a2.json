However, the radical anti-gun lobby stands between innovation and the American people. Bestselling author Frank Miniter describes amazing breakthroughs waiting to happen in gun technology -- and how gun grabbers threaten to stop progress in its tracks.In The Future of the Gun, you will learn about:Integrated electronic optics systems imbedded in firearms are making them accurate in a novice shooterâ€™s hands beyond 10 football fields.A new sniper rifle from Remington that puts five shots in .8 inches at 200 yards is the result of computer numerical control systems that are making guns cheaper and better than ever.Controlled-expansion bullets are now being engineered to perform through bone, cinderblocks and a lot of other mediums.Beginning with the AccuTrigger, a revolution has taken over gun trigger designs thatâ€™s making rifles much more accurate.3-Gun competitionsâ€”civilian competitions where competitors use semiautomatic pistols, rifles and shotgunsâ€”are pushing AR-15 manufacturers to design rifles that Hollywood hasnâ€™t even caught on to yet.â€œSmart Gunâ€ technology isnâ€™t getting R&amp;D dollars. This isnâ€™t because gun manufacturers donâ€™t see benefits in having user-identified technology, but because threatened mandates have become a lawsuit liability from gun-control groups.In the last two decades over-the-counter rifles have become as accurate as custom rifles. This is due to consumer demand and new machining capabilities.Rifle optics have evolved from low-magnification to super-high magnification capabilities and clearer class in the last two decades. These affordable scopes are the result of a competitive marketplace and new CNC machining capabilities. This has dramatically increased the range of the average marksman.Simple, ultra-reliable, cost-efficient designs from pistol makers like Glock and Beretta have made it possible to make smaller, lighter, more powerful handguns at prices (when adjusted for inflation) the world has never seen.Taurus, a Brazilian gun maker, played with using 3D printers to make guns over a decade ago. A Texas manufacturer has now made Model 1911 pistols out of steel with 3D printers â€¦ the genie is out of the bottle","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2aee8af169c66690fd48c35f33c5cd0d454b23a2","amp;dn":"The+Future+of+the+Gun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2aee8af169c66690fd48c35f33c5cd0d454b23a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,238,138,241,105,198,102,144,253,72,195,95,51,197,205,13,69,75,35,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
