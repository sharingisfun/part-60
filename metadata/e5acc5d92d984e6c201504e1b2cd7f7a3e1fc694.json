The purpose is to survive for 180 seconds in a Psychedelic tunnel by dodging the obstacles. The primary gameplay is that sometimes Zag will go through colored walls that will reverse your controls. With this unique and evil mechanic;\r\n\r\n&quot;it wonâ€™t be your reflexes that let you down, itâ€™ll be your concentration â€“ as control reversals mean youâ€™ll constantly have to keep track of whatâ€™s up and whatâ€™s down (and left and right).\r\n\r\nYou control a Zag as he hurtles down multi-colored, gyrating tunnels packed with obstacles and (worst of all) zones that reverse your controls. The obstacles arenâ€™t that hard to avoid themselves, but the zones that reverse your controls really mess with your mind. You can have the best timing in the world, but if youâ€™re pressing the wrong button, youâ€™re going to be one flat cat. Zag does change color to give you some indication of which controls are reversed, but with so much happening on-screen, that doesnâ€™t make things much easier!&quot; -Alphabetagamer\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n- The most evil game you will ever play\r\n- 2 tutorials\r\n- 1 survival mode\r\n- 1 epic Answer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5acc5d92d984e6c201504e1b2cd7f7a3e1fc694","amp;dn":"Psychocat%3A+The+Answer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5acc5d92d984e6c201504e1b2cd7f7a3e1fc694","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,172,197,217,45,152,78,108,32,21,4,225,178,205,127,122,62,31,198,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
