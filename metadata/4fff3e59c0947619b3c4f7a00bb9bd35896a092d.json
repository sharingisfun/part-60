As a result, instead of the simple &quot;jocks versus geeks&quot; paradigm of previous eras, our society now has more detailed stereotypes of the undesirable, the under-the-radar, and the ostracized: cyberpervs, neckbeards, goths, tech nerds, and anyone with a non-heterosexual identity. Each chapter of this book explores a different stereotype of the Internet user, with key themesâ€”such as gender, technophobia, and sexualityâ€”explored with regard to that specific characterization of online users.Author Lauren Rosewarne, PhD, supplies a highly interdisciplinary perspective that draws on research and theories from a range of fieldsâ€”psychology, sociology, and communications studies as well as feminist theory, film theory, political science, and philosophyâ€”to analyze what these stereotypes mean in the context of broader social and cultural issues. From cyberbullies to chronically masturbating porn addicts to desperate online-daters, readers will see the paradox in popular culture's message: that while Internet use is universal, actual Internet users are somehow subparâ€”less desirable, less cool, less friendlyâ€”than everybody else","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fff3e59c0947619b3c4f7a00bb9bd35896a092d","amp;dn":"Cyberbullies%2C+Cyberactivists%2C+Cyberpredators+-+Lauren+Rosewarne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fff3e59c0947619b3c4f7a00bb9bd35896a092d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,255,62,89,192,148,118,25,179,196,247,160,11,185,189,53,137,106,9,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
