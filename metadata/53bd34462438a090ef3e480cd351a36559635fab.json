He and his older sister Mimma perform circus acts for their village. Barbu and Mimma are sold by their parents to Caruso, a German circus master, to supposedly become part of his circus act in Berlin. On their arrival to Germany, Barbu is taken to the circus, in reality being a training camp of young thieves, and Mimma is sold to Cardinal for prostitution in his brothel. Director Ivan FÃ­la first conceived the idea for the film in 1992 in Milan, Italy, where he met street kids stealing from tourists. To research the film, he visited some of the camps where the kids were living and talked to them. The film is based on many of these kids' real life stories.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: DivX5, 720x392, 29.970 fps, 1337 Kbps, 01h49m11s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\nRatio: 1.85:1\r\n\r\nDVDRip, DUAL Audio Tracks German and Russian\r\n\r\nOptional subtitles Czech, English, Hungarian, Slovenian, Spanish, Turkish\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/eb27nweiz/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/i1rklr2x7/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/nbwjd1n63/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/wieu0bsej/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/6ll5npoqz/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53bd34462438a090ef3e480cd351a36559635fab","amp;dn":"King+of+Thieves+-+K%26ouml%3Bnig+der+Diebe+%5B2004%5D+%28multi+subs%29+drama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53bd34462438a090ef3e480cd351a36559635fab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,189,52,70,36,56,160,144,239,62,72,12,211,81,163,101,89,99,95,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
