As they take position\r\nover some of Earths major cities, David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) an MIT graduate working\r\nfor a cable company in New York City, discovers hidden transmissions in Earth's satellites\r\nwhich he realizes is a timer counting down to a coordinated attack by the aliens. With\r\nthe support of his estranged wife Constance Spano (Margaret Colin) the White House\r\nCommunications Director, he and his father Julius (Judd Hirsch) gain entrance into the\r\nOval Office to notify President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman) about the attack.\r\nWhitmore orders large-scale evacuations of the targeted cities, but the aliens attack with\r\nadvanced directed-energy weapons before these can be carried out. Whitmore, portions of\r\nhis staff, and the Levinsons narrowly escape aboard Air Force One as Washington, D.C.\r\nis destroyed.\r\n\r\nBox Office\r\n\r\nBudget: $75,000,000 (estimated)\r\nOpening Weekend: $50,200,000 (USA) (5 July 1996)\r\nGross: JPY 3,766,488,300 (Japan) (24 January 1997)\r\nRentals: $177,190,000 (USA)\r\n\r\nPlease note that all screenshot was captured at 1080p, resized to 720p\r\nand then compressed using PNG to improve the loading time.\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/68185116519947311635.png  \r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/71244973455942637575.png\r\n \nhttp://w48.imgup.net/3108c.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/16917392747704940939.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/22570519405605881132.png  \r\n \nhttp://w10.imgup.net/44f83.png\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116629/\r\n\r\n:: General ::\r\n\r\nFormat: Matroska/MKV\r\nFile Size: 11.6 GiB\r\nOverall Bit Rate: 11.5 Mbps\r\nFormat profile:   \r\nDuration: 02:24:48\r\nSample: Yes\r\nSubtitles: English\r\nChapters: Yes\r\nEncoded By oneanight\r\n\r\n:: Video Info ::\r\n\r\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\r\nWriting library: x264\r\nVideo bitrate: 10 MB\r\nResolution: 1920 X 816 pixels\r\nAspect ratio(AR): 2.35:1\r\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\r\n\r\n:: Audio Info ::\r\n\r\nFormat profile: DTS\r\nAudio Bit rate: 1509 Kbps\r\nCompression mode: Lossy\r\nBit rate mode Constant\r\nAudio Language: English\r\nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz / Bit depth 24 bits\r\nChannel positions: Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\r\nChannels: 6 channels 5.1\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e26769772d94a46c30af316c7adc5af57b2b49e6","amp;dn":"Independence+Day+-+%5B1996%5D+1080p+BDRip+x264+DTS+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e26769772d94a46c30af316c7adc5af57b2b49e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,103,105,119,45,148,164,108,48,175,49,108,122,220,90,245,123,43,73,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
