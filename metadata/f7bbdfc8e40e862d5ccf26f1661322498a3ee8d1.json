Posing as a zoologist he strikes up a relationship with Jennifer, and her koala Barnaby. On a treasure seeking adventure they stumble upon a mysterious valley where the natives worship the koala and are &quot;extraordinarily happy.&quot; Leo discovers a money making bonanza, a special native confection which when eaten produces a happy euphoria. He decides to go into business, however their confection has a most unpleasant side effect.\r\n\r\nIn his 1982 book &quot;Where Have I Been? An Autobiography&quot;, a sobered-up Sid Caesar admits that by the time he did this film, he was so far-gone because of his prescription drug and alcohol addiction, he has no memory of making this movie, or of even being in Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 608x448, 23.976 fps, 1479 Kbps, 01h34m41s\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 128 kbps\r\n\r\nVHSRip, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/v02dpsl5b/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/l63e0gep7/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/95hxzq7aj/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/rz3qwq5ij/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/5bt34bfcb/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7bbdfc8e40e862d5ccf26f1661322498a3ee8d1","amp;dn":"Barnaby+and+Me+%281978+-+Australia%29+charming+family+adventure","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7bbdfc8e40e862d5ccf26f1661322498a3ee8d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,187,223,200,228,14,134,45,92,207,38,241,102,19,34,73,138,62,232,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
