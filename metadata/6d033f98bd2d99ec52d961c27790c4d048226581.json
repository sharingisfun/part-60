These guys are amazing. I bought the album and now they are on tour and I will be driving 6 hours to catch them live. I hope by setting this album free, others will find out about them and buy their album and see them live.\r\n\r\nMy favorites are:\r This song has a brief snippet in Edge of Tomorrow, a 2014 Tom Cruise movie, how I first became interested in them.\r\n\r\nThey are kinda rockabilly malt shop ballads, IDK, define them for yourself.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01 - Trip into the Light\r\n02 - Heart of Stone\r\n03 - Cam Girl\r\n04 - Right out of Love\r\n05 - Some Days\r\n06 - Moonlight\r\n07 - White Star Bright Love\r\n08 - Settle Down\r\n09 - You're My Halo\r\n10 - Sunlight in the Rain\r\n\r\nI didn't encode this. It varies from 249-293 kbps. BTW, popping my cherry with my first .torrent. Please seed if you love it and are able to","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d033f98bd2d99ec52d961c27790c4d048226581","amp;dn":"Jeremy+%26amp%3B+The+Harlequins+-+American+Dreamer+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d033f98bd2d99ec52d961c27790c4d048226581","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,3,63,152,189,45,153,236,82,217,97,194,119,144,196,208,72,34,101,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
