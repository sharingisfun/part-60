Sewald, Hans-Dieter Jakubke (Wiley-VCH, 2009).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-3-527-31867-4\r\n\r\nThoroughly updated, incorporating around 25 % new material, Sewald/Jakubke remains the only modern and scientifically up-to-date advanced textbook on peptide biochemistry, distilling the knowledge of hundreds of publications into a highly readable synopsis of this diverse field.\r\nThe authors explain the broad fundamentals of peptide synthesis and structure, systematically addressing important families of biologically active peptides, and adopting an interdisciplinary approach that covers application areas in biotechnology, pharmaceutical science, and biomedicine. One major focus is on such &quot;hot&quot; research topics as pseudopeptides, peptidomimetics, and combinatorial synthesis.\r\nThis new edition also features study questions for each learning unit, for easier self-study and classroom teaching","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:771db602fc65cd0303f2f7a1839efdb38aa1ff56","amp;dn":"Peptides+-+Chemistry+and+Biology+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"771db602fc65cd0303f2f7a1839efdb38aa1ff56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,29,182,2,252,101,205,3,3,242,247,161,131,158,253,179,138,161,255,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
