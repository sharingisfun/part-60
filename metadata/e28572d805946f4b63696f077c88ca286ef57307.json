During the evacuation, astronaut\r\nMark Watney is struck by flying debris and is lost in the storm; the last telemetry\r\nfrom his suit indicates that it has lost pressure, with no life signs. With their launch\r\nvehicle on the verge of tipping over in the wind, and the remaining crew's lives in peril\r\nmission commander Melissa Lewis gives the order to launch without retrieving him they\r\nsubsequently leave Mars aboard the Hermes.\r\n\r\nBox Office\r\n\r\nBudget: $108,000,000 (estimated)\r\nOpening Weekend: $54,308,575 (USA) (2 October 2015)\r\nGross: $224,853,519 (USA) (25 December 2015)\r\n\r\nPlease note that all screenshot was captured at 1080p, resized to 720p\r\nand then compressed using PNG to improve the loading time.\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/52907286436361378804.png  \r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/73741572138255271581.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/62906398697203128947.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/65678185546550264493.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/31370489648567583942.png  \r\n \nhttp://n02.imgup.net/6246c.png\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt3659388/\r\n\r\n:: General ::\r\n\r\nFormat: Matroska/MKV\r\nFile Size: 11.4 GiB\r\nOverall Bit Rate: 11.5 Mbps\r\nFormat profile:   \r\nDuration: 02:21:37\r\nSample: Yes\r\nSubtitles: English\r\nChapters: Yes\r\nEncoded By oneanight\r\n\r\n:: Video Info ::\r\n\r\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\r\nWriting library: x264\r\nVideo bitrate: 10 MB\r\nResolution: 1920 X 800 pixels\r\nAspect ratio(AR): 2.40:1\r\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\r\n\r\n:: Audio Info ::\r\n\r\nFormat profile: DTS\r\nAudio Bit rate: 1509 Kbps\r\nCompression mode: Lossy\r\nBit rate mode Constant\r\nAudio Language: English\r\nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz / Bit depth 24 bits\r\nChannel positions: Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\r\nChannels: 6 channels 5.1\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e28572d805946f4b63696f077c88ca286ef57307","amp;dn":"The+Martian+-+%5B2015%5D+1080p+BluRay+x264+DTS+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e28572d805946f4b63696f077c88ca286ef57307","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,133,114,216,5,148,111,75,99,105,111,7,124,136,202,40,110,245,115,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
