Both the date and venue of this show have been disputed. It would appear that no concert occurred at this venue or on this date. On the other side this is not likely any other performance or date i have, so any help to find out the truth is more than welcome.\r\n\r\nFirst generation reel to reel (revox) &gt; behringer ultra curve pro deq 2496 audio equalizer &gt; amplifiers &gt; tascam audio cdrw750 &gt; cd &gt; computer &gt; plex tool professional XL &gt; wav &gt; flac","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf20eafdb1970e52271e7afd5c945321705a9b8c","amp;dn":"Blind+Faith+-+1969-08-16+-+Fairgrounds+Arena","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf20eafdb1970e52271e7afd5c945321705a9b8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,32,234,253,177,151,14,82,39,30,122,253,92,148,83,33,112,90,155,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
