I'm always prepared.  I checked the email during the break, a bunch of doubting Thomases.  &quot;You know, you say that Clinton was responsible for the subprime mortgage, but you never offer any proof.  You just say it and you expect everybody to believe it.  And your mind-numbed audience believes everything, but I don't.  You're not fooling me.&quot; After 28 years you would figure that, even the left would know, I don't make it up.  But let me share with you from the New York Times, September 30th, 1999. \r\n\r\nWhy Your Host Is Trending on Fakebook -\n\r\nRUSH: Your host, ladies and gentlemen, I just found out, is trending the top of the Fakebook, whatever they call it, trending, I'm at the top of it. And you know why? Here's what it says. Top of the trending: &quot;Rush Limbaugh, host says he won't endorse Donald Trump because, 'What difference does it make now?'&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrump Hits Back at Hillary, Pocahontas\r\n\r\nRUSH: They do not have the experience or the conditioning of the third reply. They get away with the initial charge and the subsequent Republican silence and embarrassment, and Republican prayers that nobody will hear it and it'll all go away. Trump hears it, replies, throws the ball back in the Democrat court -- in this case, Hillary or Elizabeth Warren -- and they don't have a lot of experience dealing with the third reply","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:442cec614e5081d2e849aea1fd6b8db8539513a7","amp;dn":"Rush+Limbaugh+-+May+25%2C+2016+Full+Podcast.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"442cec614e5081d2e849aea1fd6b8db8539513a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,44,236,97,78,80,129,210,232,73,174,161,253,107,141,184,83,149,19,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
