However, on Christmas Eve, he is visited by the doomed ghost of his former partner Jacob Marley that tells him that three spirits would visit him that night. The first one, the spirit of Christmas Past, recalls his miserable youth when he lost his only love due to his greed; the spirit of Christmas Present shows him the poor situation of Bob's family and how joyful life may be; and the spirit of Christmas Future shows his fate. Scrooge finds that life is good and time is too short and suddenly you are not there anymore, changing his behavior toward Christmas, Bob, his nephew and people in general.                \r\n\r\nYear: 1970                \r\nDirector: Ronald Neame                \r\nWriters: Charles Dickens, Leslie Bricusse                \r\nStars: Albert Finney, Edith Evans, Kenneth More, Laurence Naismith, Michael Medwin, David Collings, Anton Rodgers, Suzanne Neve, Frances Cuka, Derek Francis                \r\nGenres: Drama, Family, Fantasy, Musical, Romance, Thriller                \r\nLanguage: English                \r\n\r\nRELEASE.....................: Scrooge.1970.720p.BluRay.x264.VPPV\r\nVIDEO.......................: 1000 kbps  \r\nCODEC.......................: x264\r\nRESOLUTION..................: 1280x544                \r\nFRAME RATE..................: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO.......................: 2 Channel / HE-AAC(FDK) / 128kbps                \r\nFILE SIZE / FORMAT..........: 926MB / MP4\r\nSOURCE......................: BluRay                \r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nPoster:  \nhttp://snap.vppv.la/scrooge/1970/scrooge-1970-poster.jpg               \r\n\r\nWarning!!!
