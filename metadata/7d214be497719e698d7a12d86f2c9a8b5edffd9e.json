The source for this fanedit was the excellent Battlestar Galactica Blu-Ray set and used the 1080p/5.1 Razor (Unrated) movie and the 480p/2.0 Razor Flashbacks. All of the Razor Flashbacks episodes 3, 4, 5, 6 and part of 7 are contained within the Razor (Unrated) movie which is 1080p with surround sound.\r\n\r\n00.00-02.30 Razor Flashbacks episode1 480p\r\n02.30-04.54 Razor Flashbacks episode2 480p\r\n04.54-15.08 Razor (Unrated) 1080p\r\n15.08-18.21 Razor Flashbacks episode7 480p\r\n\r\nEpisode7 only has 1minute 17seconds of content, the rest is credits and the hilarious R&amp;D TV stinger at the very end:\r\n15.07-16.25 Razor Flashbacks episode7 flash forward to Galactica's decommissioning\r\n16.25-18.16 Razor Flashbacks credits\r\n18.16-18.20 R&amp;D TV stinger with David saying &quot;me, me, me ...&quot; and Ron pushing his stomach in and saying &quot;big head&quot;\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* hid the &quot;TO BE CONTINUED&quot; text overlays and removed the associated sound effects at the end of episode 1 and episode 2\r\n* removed the episode 2 establishing shot of an exterior zoom into Galactica\r\n* left the very funny R&amp;D stinger from the very end of episode 7 after the credits; this R&amp;D stinger wasn't used at the end of any normal episodes so it's a bit of an Easter Egg\r\n\r\nNote: The webisodes are stereo 2.0 and the Razor (Unrated) material is surround 5.1. The final file is mastered as 5.1 and the sound levels sound about right with surround speakers but listening with just stereo speakers might make the webisodes sound a bit louder than the movie portion. If the video player has a speaker setting, be sure to set it to 2.0 if you only have stereo speakers.\r\n\r\n************************************************************\r\n\r\nBattlestar.Galactica.The.Face.Of.The.Enemy.Complete.v6.1080p.2ch.subs.x265.HEVC\r\n\r\nTHIS TORRENT USES X265 HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) VIDEO\r\nPLEASE USE A PLAYER THAT SUPPORTS X265 HEVC VIDEO LIKE VLC, POTPLAYER, ETC\r\n\r\nVERSION6 HAS ENG CZE GRE ITA SUBTITLES ADDED\r\nTHE VIDEO CROPPING IS SLIGHTLY LESS THAN V5\r\n\r\nBattlestar Galactica The Face of the Enemy single file fanedit\r\nversion6 33min52sec Handbrake0.10.2.7286 443,198,845bytes\r\nsource: Japanese Blu-Ray 1080i\r\nvideo: 1920x1072 HEVC crf=23 preset=medium\r\naudio: 2-channel stereo HE-AAC 96Kbps\r\nsubtitles: built in, off by default, not hard coded - English, Czech, Greek, Italian\r\nchapters: 10 chapters, 1 for each webisode\r\n  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1338724/  \r\n\r\nsuggested viewing order:\r\ns4e11 Sometimes a Great Notion\r\ns4e11.5 The Face Of The Enemy Complete v6\r\ns4e12 A Disquiet Follows My Soul \r\n\r\nThe story is powerful, both Gaeta (Alessandro Juliani) and Sweet Eight (Grace Park) do great jobs and we finally find out what Baltar whispered into Gaeta's ear in the brig that made him attack Baltar. This is best viewed in between s4e11 and s4e12. Since the parts are all strung together some unneeded establishing shots were cut as were some overlapping clips.\r\n\r\nThis is the sixth (and final?) edit and encode of Battlestar Galactica's The Face of the Enemy 10 webisode series. This new version6 used the very best source: the newly available Japanese Battlestar Galactica Season 4 Blu-ray Box Set and was encoded with x265 HEVC video. The edges of the source have thin black lines or are ragged but with v6 slightly less cropping was used compared to v5 and the edges still look good. There are 10 named chapter markers so it is easy to navigate to each webisode's content.\r\n\r\nSubtitles were added to version6. These subtitles were create by the Internet community for English, Czech, Greek, and Italian. All 4 subtitles were carefully resynched at the start and end of the video and checked in several places. I do not understand most of the last 3 languages so there might be translation issues. Also, I did not carefully check the English subs but they look pretty good. Thank you for creating these!\r\n\r\nSPECIAL THANKS: a very special thanks to the poster of this Blu-Ray source and for the 4 subtitles. Thank you!\r\n\r\n************************************************************\r\n\r\nBattlestar.Galactica.The.Resistance.Complete.v4.480p.2ch.x265.HEVC\r\n\r\nTHIS TORRENT USES X265 HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) VIDEO\r\nPLEASE USE A PLAYER THAT SUPPORTS X265 HEVC VIDEO LIKE VLC, POTPLAYER, ETC\r\n\r\nBattlestar Galactica The Resistance single file fanedit\r\nsource: Blu-Ray 480i file but only 360i (640x360) after removing black bars\r\nversion4 25min21sec Handbrake0.10.2.7286 128,625,195bytes\r\nvideo: 720x416 HEVC crf=19 preset=medium decomb=default\r\naudio: 2-channel stereo HE-AAC 96Kbps\r\n  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0519780/  \r\n\r\nsuggested viewing order:\r\ns2e20 Lay Down Your Burdens Part2\r\ns3e00 The Resistance Complete v4\r\ns3e01 Occupation\r\n\r\nThis fanedit is The Resistance webisodes from Battlestar Galactica in a single 25minute 21second file formatted as one episode.
