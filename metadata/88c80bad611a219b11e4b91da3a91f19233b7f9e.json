When she wakes up, she checks out how many people followed her dreams and how many saw them.\r\n\r\nIt's the future. When she feels special, a voice in her head tells her: &quot;5.4 Billion+ had the same feeling in the last 4 seconds. Would you like to know who they are?&quot;\r\n\r\nHow can you feel special when everything's been done before, been felt before, been thought of before?
