Torchlight II takes you back into the quirky, fast-paced world of bloodthirsty monsters, bountiful treasures, and sinister secrets - and, once again, the fate of the world is in your hands! \r\nTorchlight II captures all the flavor and excitement of the original game - while expanding the world and adding the features players wanted most, including online and LAN co-op multiplayer. Torchlight II is fast, fun, and filled to the brim with action and loot. Adventure solo or online with your friends!\r\nMulti-player â€“ Featuring drop-in drop-out co-op play. A free matchmaking peer-to-peer service lets you make new friends and create friend lists. At any time, choose online multi-player, LAN play, or single-player. You can take your same character online/offline and across PC/Mac/Linux play.\r\nCustomizable Characters â€“ Players will create and customize a character from one of four classes available and choose an animal companion. Through cosmetic, class, and gender choices, skill path decisions, and the treasures they acquire, each character will be custom-tailored to each playerâ€™s tastes.\r\nIndividual Loot Drops â€“ Loot ninjaâ€™ing is a thing of the past! Every player sees their own loot drops onscreen. Loot drops are not class specific since all classes can equip all in-game items, provided the required stats are met. Items can also be traded between players.\r\nPets â€“ Look for all new pets in Torchlight 2, the wolf, panther, domestic cat, hawk, chakawary, bulldog, and the papillon. Players will choose a pet to accompany them. Pets can level up along with the player, and will help in battle, learn spells, carry items, and perform a variety of support services. They can also be sent back to town to sell unwanted items, and even return with potions and scrolls!\r\nRandomized Overworld and Dungeons â€“ Explore randomly generated dungeons within the game at any time for extra experience and rare loot. The Overworld areas of vast snowy morasses, desert wastes, and highland plains are also randomly generated. Players will encounter weather, day and night cycles, random quest givers, and random events, creating hours of non-storyline specific adventuring.\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: XP SP3 / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10\r\nProcessor: x86-compatible 1.4GHz or faster processor\r\nMemory: 1 GB System RAM\r\nHard Disk Space: 1.7GB free space (subject to change)\r\nGraphics: DirectX compatible 3D graphics card with at least 256MB of addressable memory\r\nDirectXÂ®: 9.0c\r\nInternet: A broadband internet connection for online multiplayer\r\nMouse, Keyboard\r\nOnline multiplayer requires a free Runic Account","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c731066089cf614ee680aaec6616bd4cf6c58cfd","amp;dn":"Torchlight+II+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c731066089cf614ee680aaec6616bd4cf6c58cfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,49,6,96,137,207,97,78,230,128,170,236,102,22,189,76,246,197,140,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
