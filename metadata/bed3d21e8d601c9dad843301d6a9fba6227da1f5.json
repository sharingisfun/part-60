Serpe et al. (Springer, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-3-319-24988-9\r\n\r\nThis book presents the basics and applications of photonic materials. It focuses on the utility of these devices for sensing, biosensing, and displays.\r\nThe book includes fundamental aspects with a particular focus on the application of photonic materials.\r\nThe field of photonic materials is both a burgeoning, and mature field. There are new advances being made on a daily basis, all based on the fundamental roots set by work by those like Ozin, Thomas, Asher, and others","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bed3d21e8d601c9dad843301d6a9fba6227da1f5","amp;dn":"Photonic+Materials+for+Sensing%2C+Biosensing+and+Display+Devices","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bed3d21e8d601c9dad843301d6a9fba6227da1f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,211,210,30,141,96,28,157,173,132,51,1,214,169,251,166,34,125,161,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
