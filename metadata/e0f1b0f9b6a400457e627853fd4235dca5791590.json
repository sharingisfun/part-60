Fight hunger, cold, heat and dangerous environment around you. Conquer your environment, build a base, explore your world. But the biggest danger is the other players. Create alliances and destroy your enemies. Hurtworld designed for the hardcore audience and aims to oppress. \r\n\r\nThe game world - it's a huge desert, filled with dangerous creatures, animals and harsh conditions. Even if you are prepared and protected, random incidents can destroy all your plans. \r\n\r\nThe main part of Hurtworld is PvP. However, killing other players will not be the main objective, but merely a further embodiment of the game play. Developers believe that the banal killing all the players will degrade the base - survival. So each player will be another main purpose. \r\n\r\nEach player will be able to build a house or a castle, using the resources of all shapes and sizes. Already in the alpha version Hurtworld system construction finalized and looks good. At the moment, developers want to create a whole library of building blocks and resources.\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n1. Run the installer then use shortcut provided on desktop\r\n2.
