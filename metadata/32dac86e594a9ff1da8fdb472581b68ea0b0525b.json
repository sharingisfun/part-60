Are these defences really what they seem? The rhino's thick folds of skin are in fact surprisingly sophisticated radiators. But what other purpose could a hedgehog's spines have apart from protection? Catching apples, perhaps?\r\n\r\nSome animals have mastered the art of deception. The cuckoo lays its eggs in the nest of other birds and tricks them into raising its young, while the spooky looking death's-head hawkmoth deceives hundreds of bees to steal their honey. How do these cheats and imposters get away with it?\r\n\r\nSource: BBC Two-HD TS[AVC/AC3] DDD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAVC 1080i &gt; x264 1080p (H264 high @L5.1 BluRay) 2pass approx. 4.7Mbps\r\nAC3 2.0 original stream mux [Dolby Digital]\r\nselectable SRT English CC Subtitles\r\n\r\nSize: 1.46Gb - 1/3 DVD\r\n\r\nHigh quality encode.\r\n\r\nEnjoy,\r\n\r\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32dac86e594a9ff1da8fdb472581b68ea0b0525b","amp;dn":"BBC+David+Attenborough%27s+Natural+Curiosities+S01E07+-+Defence+an","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32dac86e594a9ff1da8fdb472581b68ea0b0525b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,218,200,110,89,74,159,241,218,143,219,71,37,129,182,142,160,176,82,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
