The volume presents the fundamental and advanced concepts, principles, and models as well as their first and novel combinations and applications in quantum (physical) chemical theory of bonding, molecular reactivity, and aromaticity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccb016ae1cab98c7327631432ad5fd257f82322a","amp;dn":"Quantum+Nanochemistry+Vol.+3.+-+Quantum+Molecules+and+Reactivity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccb016ae1cab98c7327631432ad5fd257f82322a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,176,22,174,28,171,152,199,50,118,49,67,42,213,253,37,127,130,50,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
