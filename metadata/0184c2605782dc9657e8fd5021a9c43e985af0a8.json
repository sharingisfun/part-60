I'll see 100 people downloading and then activity goes to zero once they all get what they want.  It's unfortunate!  But, I seed my torrents 24/7, unless I'm doing a reboot or we experience a power outage.  If you start downloading one of my posts and it comes to a halt, don't give up on it, I'll be back online as soon as 'the internet God' allows","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0184c2605782dc9657e8fd5021a9c43e985af0a8","amp;dn":"An+Accidental+Christmas+%282007%29+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0184c2605782dc9657e8fd5021a9c43e985af0a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,132,194,96,87,130,220,150,87,232,253,80,33,169,196,62,152,90,240,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
