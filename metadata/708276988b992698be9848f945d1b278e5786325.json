With six tiers of in-app purchasing options to choose from, Zombies fans will be able to take their experience to a whole new level by unlocking additional areas and securing better weapons in much less time. Please note that CoD points are only applicable in single player.\r\n\r\nâ€¢\tBuy CoD points in the Main Menu to use when you run out of earned points in-game.\r\nâ€¢\tCoD points can be spent on anything in the game such as reviving, opening doors, weapons, perks, and the mystery box but are only used when you do not have enough earned points.\r\nâ€¢\tRevives can also be bought with CoD points if you die without the revive perk, although the three revive limit still applies.\r\nâ€¢\tNote: Your CoD points will be lost if the app is uninstalled from your device.\r\n\r\nSure, earning Achievements and Point-Multipliers is nice, but to survive these Co-Op Maps, youâ€™ll need friends as much as youâ€™ll need firepower. Lucky for you, not only will the weapons and perks you love from Call of Duty lie at your fingertips, you can join with up to 4 players via Wi-Fi to play mulitiplayer. \r\n\r\nAs if that wasnâ€™t enough, Call of Duty: Black Ops Zombies also includes â€œDead-Ops Arcadeâ€ mode, an arcade-style top-down shooter perfectly suited for mobile combat vets. Unlocking the mode is easyâ€”simply find the four missing coins in the gameâ€™s menus.\r\n\r\nAnd donâ€™t forget to download the Call of Duty: ELITE Mobile App for an inside-edge on your console Call of Duty Multiplayer experience.
