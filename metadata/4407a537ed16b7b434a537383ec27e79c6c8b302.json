They recruited drummer Jerry Shirley, formerly of Humble Pie, and the then-unknown vocalist Dave King. They took their name from a combination of the founding members' names. However, Way then discovered that he could not escape from his recording contract with Chrysalis Records, and then received a tempting offer to play for Ozzy Osbourne, so he abandoned the project without ever playing on a single record. Bringing in session bassist Mick Feat, the band then recorded their debut album, Fastway (Feat was uncredited on the album).\r\n\r\nAfter critical and commercial success, the band toured to promote the album (with one-time Fixx bassist Alfie Agius  as their session bass player). The band then recruited Charlie McCracken, formerly of Taste, as &quot;permanent&quot; bassist, and released another success in the form of All Fired Up the following year. After the hardships of touring, Shirley and McCracken subsequently left.\r\n\r\nanalogkid speaks:  Great band I saw em on there first big tour. It was Iron Maiden, Fastway and Saxon. And I could go on and on, suffice to say they were very good at the time and their music was then and is now still solid Rock.\r\n\r\nYear:\t2015\r\n\r\nStyle:\tHard &amp; Heavy\r\n\r\nCountry: United Kingdom\r\n\r\nFormat:\t320 mp3\r\n\r\nSize:\t121.80 MB\r\n\r\n\t\r\nAdded:\t08/01/2016\r\n\r\nFiles:\t16\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription:\t\r\n\r\nLength : 0:51:33\r\n\r\nTracks :\r\n\r\n01.
