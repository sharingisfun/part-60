The band got its name from the title of Aldous Huxley's book The Doors of Perception, which itself was a reference to a quote made by William Blake, &quot;If the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear to man as it is, infinite.&quot; \r\n\r\nThey were unique and among the most controversial and influential rock acts of the 1960s, mostly because of Morrison's lyrics and charismatic but unpredictable stage persona. After Morrison's death on 3 July 1971 at age 27, the remaining members continued as a trio releasing no memorable material until disbanding in 1973. Due to the fact that with Morrison gone the Doors were closed. \r\n    \r\nALBUM: The Complete Stockholm '68 Tapes\r\n    \r\nYEAR:  2015\r\n    \r\nCOUNTRY: USA\r\n    \r\nSTYLE: Classic Rock\r\n    \r\nDURATION: 1:49:09\r\n    \r\nFILE FORMAT: FLAC (image+.cue)\r\n    \r\nQUALITY: Lossless\r\n\r\nSize: 766 MB (Files: 45)\r\n   \r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nDisc 1\r\n\r\n1.
