Turner and Riley also play the title characters: a suburban mother and daughter with a dysfunctional relationship. The series' main characters consist of Kath Day-Knight, a cheerful 50-year-old woman, her self-indulgent daughter Kim Craig, Kath's boyfriend and second husband, the metrosexual Kel Knight, as well as Kim's estranged husband Brett Craig and her lonely, overweight &quot;second best friend&quot; Sharon Strzelecki. The series is set in Fountain Lakes, a fictional suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. It is primarily filmed in Patterson Lakes.[1] The series lampoons suburban living, particularly kitsch lower-middle-class Australian people, who are colloquially known in the country as &quot;bogans&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d5863b2fd8d38e138cc06271bfaf95a05202799","amp;dn":"Kath+%26amp%3B+Kim","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d5863b2fd8d38e138cc06271bfaf95a05202799","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,88,99,178,253,141,56,225,56,204,6,39,27,250,249,90,5,32,39,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
