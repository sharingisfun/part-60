The remastered material included spans the years 1981 to 1984. The compilation includes the band's debut independent single Getting out of Hand, from 1981, as well as the 5 songs from the group's debut self-titled EP released in 1982, both of which are considered rarities and have been long out of print.\r\n\r\nAlso included are tracks the group released in 1982 for compilation albums, including the instrumental Bitchen Summer/Speedway (first released on the compilation Rodney On The ROQ Vol. III), No Mag Commercial and the theme song for the radio program Rock And Roll Alternative.\r\n\r\nThe group also included four unreleased demos done in 1981, including covers of The Turtles' Outside Chance and Paul Revere &amp; The Raiders' Steppin' Out. To close the release, the band included two unreleased live songs done in 1984, the only songs on which bassist Michael Steele plays, a cover of Love's 7 and 7 Is, and &quot;Tell Me&quot;, included on their debut album All Over The Place.\r\n\r\nThe title of the compilation is taken from the spoken intro of the instrumental Bitchen Summer/Speedway.\r\n\r\nTRACK LISTING:\r\n\r\n&quot;Bitchen Summer/Speedway&quot; (1982) (Susanna Hoffs/David Roback)\r\n&quot;Getting Out of Hand&quot; (1981) (Vicki Peterson)\r\n&quot;Call on Me&quot; (1981) (S.
