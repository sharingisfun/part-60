While there he meets some colorful locals and pursues a dormant desire to become a movie star - but never can quite put the past behind him. In this meditation on love and narcissism across continents, JÃ©rÃ´me goes far in the sun-drenched City of Angels but ultimately arrives at an old Hollywood maxim: there's no place like home.\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/s50Mrmm.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0a9612035bfad256b68e9290c32f0ed61537657","amp;dn":"Hollywood%2C+je+t%27aime+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0a9612035bfad256b68e9290c32f0ed61537657","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,169,97,32,53,191,173,37,107,104,233,41,12,50,240,237,97,83,118,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
