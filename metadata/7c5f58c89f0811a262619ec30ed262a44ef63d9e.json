I usually go for ereaders which support the greatest number of formats. \r\n\r\nMy naming convention is different than found in collections that come from Calibre. I hate it when the books are by book title and not by author, because I want the books by the same author to be shown together even when they are not grouped in a folder.\r\n\r\nSources\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThese are not my own scans or OCR. They have been collected over many years from the web, either from huge messy book torrents containing a bit of everything or from free download sites such as gutenberg, and a bunch of them came with my e-readers. \r\nMy only merit is organizational, but I assure you that it was quite a bit of work. I picked those which belong to this category from the chaos of most book torrents, or downloaded the free books one by one. Then I renamed them consistently to prune out doubles and make search easy. Iâ€™ve taken out meaningless folder numbers , deleted .opf and other useless files. In many cases Iâ€™ve added a .txt file with info about authors, added authorâ€™s year of birth and death, or found a book cover when there wasnâ€™t any. \r\n\r\nYou might find some books twice: usually because one is a scan of a regular book and the other one with the blown-up font used for e-readers, or sometimes one will include a cover and the other wonâ€™t. .. things like that. The collection is not compressed, so if these things donâ€™t matter to you, feel free to skip downloading one of the two","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c5f58c89f0811a262619ec30ed262a44ef63d9e","amp;dn":"British+%26amp%3B+Irish+Literature+-+The+Classics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c5f58c89f0811a262619ec30ed262a44ef63d9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,95,88,200,159,8,17,162,98,97,158,195,14,210,98,164,78,246,61,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
