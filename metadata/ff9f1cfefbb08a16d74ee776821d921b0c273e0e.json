Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot; politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nGuest: Paul Mecurio\r\n\r\nEpisode 308: A frotastic Anthony begins todayâ€™s TACS waxing on Florida Evans, Jamesâ€™s death, and sad TV episodes, we see Gavin McInnes picking apart pandering commercials, Ant points out racial differences in commercials, and gushes about the Oculus for Samsung. We see a video for â€œVirtuaDolls,â€ get into jerkoff and virtual porn chat, hear from a few callers, talk about the hypocrisy in affirmative action, a hot cat loving poker player, candidates dropping out of the race, Trump vs. Jeb, and TACS gets all sorts of forensic on Sam Abernathy. Ant talks about his upcoming date, a life sucking plane explosion, Utahâ€™s thoughts on porn, a pointless Melissa Harris-Perry news story, fake ass professors, The People V. O.J. Simpson, democrats sucking up, Casey Anthonyâ€™s yard sale, and Sydney Simpson. Paul Mecurio (finally) arrives to yap it up with Ant about assholes on the subway, the lying homeless, scary ass Bill Devane, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Paul tells a super gay overpriced salad story, they discuss John Travoltaâ€™s face and hair, Stephen Hawkingâ€™s â€œbrilliance,â€ Paul's podcast, and Paul gives VR porn a whirl.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff9f1cfefbb08a16d74ee776821d921b0c273e0e","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2016-02-03+Paul+Mecurio+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff9f1cfefbb08a16d74ee776821d921b0c273e0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,159,28,254,251,176,138,22,215,78,231,118,130,29,146,27,12,39,62,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
