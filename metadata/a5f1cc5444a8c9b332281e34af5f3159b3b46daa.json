Once you get a grasp of what it is all about, you just continue on with the flow until the documentary reaches its conclusion.\r\n\r\nFilmed over a 10-year period, Making a Murderer is an unprecedented real-life thriller about Steven Avery, a DNA exoneree who, while in the midst of exposing corruption in local law enforcement, finds himself the prime suspect in a grisly new crime. Set in America's heartland, the series takes viewers inside a high-stakes criminal case where reputation is everything and things are never as they appear.\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt5189670/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5f1cc5444a8c9b332281e34af5f3159b3b46daa","amp;dn":"Making+A+Murderer+%2810-part+series%29+WebRip+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5f1cc5444a8c9b332281e34af5f3159b3b46daa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,241,204,84,68,168,201,179,50,40,30,52,175,95,49,89,179,180,109,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
