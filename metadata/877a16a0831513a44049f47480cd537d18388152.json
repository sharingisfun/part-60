S. Ruzer, N. H. Harley (CRC, 2013).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-4398-5519-5\r\n\r\nWith the rapid growth of the nanotechnology industry, the need to understand the biological effects of aerosol exposure has become increasingly important. Featuring contributions by leading experts in the field, Aerosols Handbook: Measurement, Dosimetry, and Health Effects, Second Edition offers an up-to-date overview of many aspects of aerosols, from properties to health effects and epidemiology.\r\n\r\nCovering indoor, outdoor, industrial, medical, pharmaceutical, and radioactive aerosols, this book explores aerosol dosimetry by defining terms such as exposure and dose. In addition, it looks at nanometer particles, the mechanism of aerosol deposition in the lungs, and modeling deposition with a corresponding uncertainty in risk assessment. The text also emphasizes the importance of accurate aerosol measurements, particularly breathing zone exposure assessments.\r\n\r\nExamining radioactive aerosols, the book discusses lessons learned from nuclear accidents, radon and thoron, and long-lived radionuclides in the environment. It brings together research on both radioactive and nonradioactive aerosols, supplying readers with a more complete view of how aerosols behave in the lungs.\r\n\r\nNew in This Edition\r\n\r\nFive new chapters that address the safety of nanomaterials, dealing with nanoparticle cell penetration, high aspect ratio nanomaterials, nanoaerosols in drug delivery, risk assessment, and health effects\r\nNew chapters on atmospheric pollution related to climate change, chemical analyses of particle filter deposits, and classical nucleation theory\r\nNew data on measurement, dosimetry, and health effects\r\n\r\nUpdated throughout, this second edition continues to be an essential resource for those who study exposure, dosages, and toxicity to develop treatments for exposure, reduce air pollution, and establish better safety regulations, particularly in industries using nanotechnologies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:877a16a0831513a44049f47480cd537d18388152","amp;dn":"Aerosols+Handbook+-+Measurement%2C+Dosimetry%2C+and+Health+Effects+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"877a16a0831513a44049f47480cd537d18388152","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,122,22,160,131,21,19,164,64,73,244,116,128,205,83,125,24,56,129,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
