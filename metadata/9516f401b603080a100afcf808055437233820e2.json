Like Los Angeles, Lemonade's cuisine is carefully blended with variety. L.A. is agents and movie grips, surfers and yoga moms, students and celebrities, and a wide mix of different culinary traditions. At Lemonade the marketplace salads, unique sandwiches, and slow-simmered stews taste as though every culture stirred a bit into the potâ€•for example, the skirt steak with grilled onions and piquillo peppers with its smoky depth, pairs perfectly with the snappy salad of Chinese long beans, plums, and scallion vinaigrette.\r\n\r\nA comfortable place where locals and visitors enjoy a rotating daily spread of deliciousness, the recipes, more than 120 in all, stress simple cooking preparation with a global taste, and are a perfect fit for today's on-the-go lifestyles and perceptive palates. And, of course, it wouldn't be L.A. without the amazing dessertsâ€•from banana mascarpone layer cake to caramel fleur de sel macaroons to peanut butter milk chocolate cookies, there are recipes for treats galore, plus ten different recipes for delicious flavors of lemonade. The Lemonade Cookbook: Southern California Comfort Food from L.A.'s Favorite Modern Cafeteria speaks to all cooks who want to make sophisticated highly-urban &quot;comfort food&quot; with ease. \r\n\r\n                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\n                          Visit us for more Awesome ebooks             \r\n\r\n                               http://booksdeity.com/\r\n \r\n                         **********************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9516f401b603080a100afcf808055437233820e2","amp;dn":"The+Lemonade+Cookbook+by+Alan+Jackson%2C+et+al.epub+%7BBD%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9516f401b603080a100afcf808055437233820e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,22,244,1,182,3,8,10,16,10,252,248,8,5,84,55,35,56,32,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
