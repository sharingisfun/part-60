Over a packed mini-break, they sample the city's finest sausages, cakes, wines and spirits. They visit fairgrounds, cafes and sewers, and also the home of one of Vienna's most famous sons, while Richard suffers an allergic reaction and Chris breaks something valuable.\r\n\r\n2)  Paris \r\nRichard Ayoade goes hurtling through a ruthlessly efficient mini-break in Paris with presenter and comedian Mel Giedroyc. Their base is a chic hotel famed for being the place where Oscar Wilde died, but there's no time to hang about soaking up the literary atmosphere, as they head to the Montparnasse Tower for arguably the best view of Paris, and one which has the bonus of including the Eiffel Tower. There's also calf's head casserole and snails, a scooter tour, `green fairy' absinthe, a Cordon Bleu cookery school, bespoke perfume and an art tour.\r\n\r\n3)  Copenhagen \r\nRichard Ayoade is joined by Noel Fielding for a quickfire 48-hour break in Danish capital Copenhagen, where they join a cycle tour of the city, sample some stunning sandwiches and visit an underground art gallery. They also find the time for a trip to the Tivoli Gardens and taste Danish pastries and beer at the Carlsberg Brewery.\r\n\r\n4)  Moscow \r\nRichard Ayoade is joined by Greg Davies for two days in Moscow. The pair's first port of call in the Russian capital is Red Square, where their appreciation of the Kremlin, St Basil's and Lenin's tomb is rudely interrupted as the tanks roll by at rehearsals for a military parade. They also visit the Cosmonaut Museum and try genuine space food, followed by a visit to one of the strangest circuses in the world.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d3/Travel-Man-48-Hours-In-Series-2-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5d/Travel-Man-48-Hours-In-Series-2-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/51/Travel-Man-48-Hours-In-Series-2-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ed/Travel-Man-48-Hours-In-Series-2-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f1/Travel-Man-48-Hours-In-Series-2-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/00/Travel-Man-48-Hours-In-Series-2-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9e/Travel-Man-48-Hours-In-Series-2-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/08/Travel-Man-48-Hours-In-Series-2-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c5/Travel-Man-48-Hours-In-Series-2-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/27/Travel-Man-48-Hours-In-Series-2-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/71/Travel-Man-48-Hours-In-Series-2-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a0/Travel-Man-48-Hours-In-Series-2-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fd/Travel-Man-48-Hours-In-Series-2-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c5/Travel-Man-48-Hours-In-Series-2-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/87/Travel-Man-48-Hours-In-Series-2-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b7/Travel-Man-48-Hours-In-Series-2-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3171 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 25mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 4\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 534 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://thetvdb.com/?tab=season&amp;seriesid=293753&amp;seasonid=649813&amp;lid=7\r\n\r\n2)  Related Documentaries \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Travel%20Man%3A%2048%20Hours%20In%3A%20Series%201","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d7c634fa71ef931a79e29b30481fd1fd3d931ee","amp;dn":"Travel+Man+48+Hours+In+Series+2+1of4+Vienna+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d7c634fa71ef931a79e29b30481fd1fd3d931ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,124,99,79,167,30,249,49,167,158,41,179,4,129,253,31,211,217,49,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
