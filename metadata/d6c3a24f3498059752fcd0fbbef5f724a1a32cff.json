Kicking off in the 60s with The Rockin' Vicars and Sam Gopal and culminating in his collaboration with Dave Grohl on the Probot project in 2004, this 2cd anthology of course includes the inevitable &quot;Silver Machine&quot; marking Lemmy's time with Hawkwind and a pick of Motorhead tracks - 'Damage Case', 'Iron Horse', and more. Also included are Lemmy's less well known collaborations with other artists including The Damned ('Ballroom Blitz'), The Ramones ('R.A.M.O.N.E.S') Wendy O'Williams of the Plasmatics ('Stand By Your Man') and of course Girlschool and the UK top 5 hit ('Please Don't Touch').
