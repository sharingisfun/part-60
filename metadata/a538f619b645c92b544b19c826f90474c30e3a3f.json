Houpis (CRC, 2012).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-4665-5224-1\r\n\r\nPresenting the latest developments in the field, Wind Energy Systems: Control Engineering Design offers a novel take on advanced control engineering design techniques for wind turbine applications. The book introduces concurrent quantitative engineering techniques for the design of highly efficient and reliable controllers, which can be used to solve the most critical problems of multi-megawatt wind energy systems.\r\n\r\nThis book is based on the authorsâ€™ experience during the last two decades designing commercial multi-megawatt wind turbines and control systems for industry leaders, including NASA and the European Space Agency. This work is their response to the urgent need for a truly reliable concurrent engineering methodology for the design of advanced control systems. Outlining a roadmap for such a coordinated architecture, the authors consider the links between all aspects of a multi-megawatt wind energy project, in which the wind turbine and the control system must be cooperatively designed to achieve an optimized, reliable, and successful system.\r\n\r\nLook inside for links to a free download of QFTCTâ€”a new interactive CAD tool for QFT controller design with MATLABÂ® that the authors developed with the European Space Agency.\r\n\r\nThe textbookâ€™s big-picture insights can help students and practicing engineers control and optimize a wind energy system, in which large, flexible, aerodynamic structures are connected to a demanding variable electrical grid and work automatically under very turbulent and unpredictable environmental conditions. The book covers topics including robust QFT control, aerodynamics, mechanical and electrical dynamic modeling, economics, reliability, and efficiency. It also addresses standards, certification, implementation, grid integration, and power quality, as well as environmental and maintenance issues.\r\n\r\nTo reinforce understanding, the authors present real examples of experimentation with commercial multi-megawatt direct-drive wind turbines, as well as on-shore, offshore, floating, and airborne wind turbine applications. They also offer a unique in-depth exploration of the quantitative feedback theory (QFT)â€”a proven, successful robust control technique for real-world applicationsâ€”as well as advanced switching control techniques that help engineers exceed classical linear limitations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a538f619b645c92b544b19c826f90474c30e3a3f","amp;dn":"Wind+Energy+Systems+-+Control+Engineering+Design","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a538f619b645c92b544b19c826f90474c30e3a3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,56,246,25,182,69,201,43,84,75,25,200,38,249,4,116,195,14,58,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
