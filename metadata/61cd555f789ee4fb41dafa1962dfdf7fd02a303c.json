Parvulescu, Erhard Kemnitz (Elsevier, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-0-444-63587-7\r\n\r\nNew Materials for Catalytic Applications proposes the use of both new and existing materials for catalytic applications, such as zeolites, metal oxides, microporous and mesoporous materials, and monocrystals. In addition, metal-oxides are discussed from a new perspective, i.e. nano- and photocatalytic applications.\r\n\r\nThe material presents these concepts with a new focus on strategies in synthesis, synthesis based on a rational design, the correlation between basic properties/potential applications, and new catalytic solutions for acid-base, redox, hydrogenation, photocatalytic reactions, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPresents organometallic concepts for the synthesis of nanocatalysts\r\nProvides a synthesis of new materials following the fluorolytic sol-gel concept\r\nCovers electronic and photocatalytic properties via synthesis of nano-oxide materials\r\nDetails the nature of sites in MOFs generating catalytic properties immobilization of triflates in solid matrices for organic reactions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61cd555f789ee4fb41dafa1962dfdf7fd02a303c","amp;dn":"New+Materials+for+Catalytic+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61cd555f789ee4fb41dafa1962dfdf7fd02a303c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,205,85,95,120,158,228,251,65,218,250,25,98,223,223,127,208,42,48,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
