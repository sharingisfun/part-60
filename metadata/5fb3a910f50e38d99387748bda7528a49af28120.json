As you proceed, collecting spirits along the way, new Light Cores become available, allowing you to visit the Red, Green, Yellow and Blue worlds. It is possible to alternate between them on the fly, allowing for a very dynamic gameplay.\r\nSome unique objects are particular of a world. For example, steam machines will only work in the Red world, since it is the hottest one. Wood trampolines only exist in the Green world, and so on","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fb3a910f50e38d99387748bda7528a49af28120","amp;dn":"Quatro+Luzes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fb3a910f50e38d99387748bda7528a49af28120","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,179,169,16,245,14,56,217,147,135,116,139,218,117,40,164,154,242,129,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
