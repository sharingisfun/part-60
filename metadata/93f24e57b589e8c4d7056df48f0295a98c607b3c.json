The opening 45 minutes or so sound \r\nstrong and good, but the intensity starts to flag towards the end. Jimmy \r\nbutchers the solo in Whole Lotta Love, and the end encores sound tired \r\n(&quot;Can you do the dinosaur rock?&quot; reflected what the band thought playing \r\nthese old tunes). This was also the last concert in the United Kingdom but \r\nRobert, before as he left the stage, said: &quot;We'll see you soon. Very soon. \r\nDon't know about the Marquee, but somewhere soon.&quot; They couldn't knew what \r\nhappened a year later. Some problems with Page's guitar and PA system \r\ntruncated Over The Hills And Far Away and Misty Mountain Hop","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93f24e57b589e8c4d7056df48f0295a98c607b3c","amp;dn":"led+zeppelin+1979.08.11+knebworth+festival","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93f24e57b589e8c4d7056df48f0295a98c607b3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,242,78,87,181,137,232,196,215,5,109,244,143,2,149,169,140,96,123,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
