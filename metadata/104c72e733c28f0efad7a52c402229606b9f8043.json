It is an English-language film that was directed, edited and photographed by British talent, co-written and co-produced by a Canadian, and cast with Irish and American actors in two major roles. Each actor and actress speaks in his or her native language, predominantly English, with only a handful of lines coming in Hebrew. \r\n\r\nThe story is set during the 1948 Independence War, while the Arabs try to gain control of the Holy Land. The four central characters are Irishman Edward Mulhare, American Allan Goodman, a Palestinian, and a Yemenite girl. As the foursome holds tenuously onto the militarily crucial Hill 24, which overlooks the road to Jerusalem, the film flashes back to show why and how these disparate souls have come together for this undertaking. Through their personal stories, a broader socio-political context is presented, including the dilemmas faced by the new state. Although it is the Israeli point of view that is predominant, it is not excessively stressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 704x480, 23.976 fps, 1800 Kbps, 01h41m29s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\nRatio: 4:3\r\n\r\nVHSRip, mostly English audio with some Hebrew which has hardcoded English subtitles\r\n\r\nOptional subtitles in English and Russian\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttps://postimg.org/image/6e1dd1arl/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttps://postimg.org/image/g1hhr576p/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/b43x6157l/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/kpxhmbwdd/ \nhttps://postimg.org/image/x5u7g2ppd/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:104c72e733c28f0efad7a52c402229606b9f8043","amp;dn":"Hill+24+Doesn%27t+Answer+%5B1955+-+Israel%5D+%28English%29+1948+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"104c72e733c28f0efad7a52c402229606b9f8043","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,76,114,231,51,194,143,14,250,215,165,44,64,34,41,96,107,159,128,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
