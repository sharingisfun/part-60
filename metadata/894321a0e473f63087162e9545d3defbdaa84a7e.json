A pilot called &quot;Audition Show&quot; was made in 1955, but never broadcast. 143 other episodes were broadcast - all half-an-hour long except for a 1959 one-hour live special. The series starred Phil Silvers as Master Sergeant Ernest G. Bilko of the United States Army.\r\n\r\n The series was created and largely written by Nat Hiken, and won three consecutive Emmy Awards for Best Comedy Series. The show is sometimes titled Sergeant Bilko or simply Bilko in reruns, and is very often referred to by these names, both on-screen and by viewers. The show's success transformed Silvers from a journeyman comedian into a star, and writer-producer Hiken from a highly regarded behind-the-scenes comedy writer into a publicly recognized creator.\r\n\r\nInvader97","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:894321a0e473f63087162e9545d3defbdaa84a7e","amp;dn":"The+Phil+Silvers+Show+%28Bilko%29+Season+3+-+Three+Episodes+Missing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"894321a0e473f63087162e9545d3defbdaa84a7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,67,33,160,228,115,246,48,135,22,46,149,69,211,222,251,218,168,74,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
