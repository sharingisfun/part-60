The recordings resulted in two 1979 albums, Rust Never Sleeps, a collection of the new songs performed on the tour, and Live Rust, a live album chronicling the bulk of the set list. The Cow Palace show appeared as a theatrically released film also called Rust Never Sleeps that later was issued as a home video. The Dutch Immortal label has acquired European rights to this material and issued a DVD, Live in San Francisco, that is essentially a reissue of the Rust Never Sleeps film, as well as this Live in San Francisco double-CD set, which is a separately released audio companion to the DVD, making it similar to, but not exactly the same as, the earlier Live Rust album. In fact, it contains the same songs, in the same order, as Live Rust, with the exception of two songs, &quot;Thrasher&quot; and &quot;Welfare Mothers,&quot; that are not on Live Rust, but are on the Rust Never Sleeps album. Still, Live Rust gets the nod over this version, even though it's a little longer, if only because the performances on Live Rust are superior. Young forgets the lyrics to &quot;Thrasher&quot; at one point, for instance, but, since he's playing solo, he just keeps strumming until they come to him","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:168afdd9977c9b22463fdace068e483d65260f80","amp;dn":"Neil+Young+-+Live+In+San+Francisco+1978+%5BFlac%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"168afdd9977c9b22463fdace068e483d65260f80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,138,253,217,151,124,155,34,70,63,218,206,6,142,72,61,101,38,15,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
