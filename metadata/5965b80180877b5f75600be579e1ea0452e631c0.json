This is best viewed in between s4e11 and s4e12. Since the parts are all strung together some unneeded establishing shots were cut as were some overlapping clips.\r\n\r\nThis is the sixth (and final?) edit and encode of Battlestar Galactica's The Face of the Enemy 10 webisode series. This new version6 used the very best source: the newly available Japanese Battlestar Galactica Season 4 Blu-ray Box Set and was encoded with x265 HEVC video. The edges of the source have thin black lines or are ragged but with v6 slightly less cropping was used compared to v5 and the edges still look good. There are 10 named chapter markers so it is easy to navigate to each webisode's content.\r\n\r\nSubtitles were added to version6. These subtitles were create by the Internet community for English, Czech, Greek, and Italian. All 4 subtitles were carefully resynched at the start and end of the video and checked in several places. I do not understand most of the last 3 languages so there might be translation issues. Also, I did not carefully check the English subs but they look pretty good. Thank you for creating these!\r\n\r\nSPECIAL THANKS: a very special thanks to the poster of this Blu-Ray source and for the 4 subtitles.
