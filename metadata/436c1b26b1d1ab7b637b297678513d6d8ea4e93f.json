Piqueras-Fiszman, C. Spence (WP, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-0-08-100350-3\r\n\r\nMultisensory Flavor Perception: From Fundamental Neuroscience Through to the Marketplace provides state-of-the-art coverage of the latest insights from the rapidly-expanding world of multisensory flavor research. The book highlights the various types of crossmodal interactions, such as sound and taste, and vision and taste, showing their impact on sensory and hedonic perception, along with their consumption in the context of food and drink.\r\n\r\nThe chapters in this edited volume review the existing literature, also explaining the underlying neural and psychological mechanisms which lead to crossmodal perception of flavor. The book brings together research which has not been presented before, making it the first book in the market to cover the literature of multisensory flavor perception by incorporating the latest in psychophysics and neuroscience.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthored by top academics and world leaders in the field\r\nTakes readers on a journey from the neurological underpinnings of multisensory flavor perception, then presenting insights that can be used by food companies to create better flavor sensations for consumers\r\nOffers a wide perspective on multisensory flavor perception, an area of rapidly expanding knowledge","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:436c1b26b1d1ab7b637b297678513d6d8ea4e93f","amp;dn":"Multisensory+Flavor+Perception","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"436c1b26b1d1ab7b637b297678513d6d8ea4e93f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,108,27,38,177,209,171,123,99,123,41,118,120,81,61,109,142,164,233,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
