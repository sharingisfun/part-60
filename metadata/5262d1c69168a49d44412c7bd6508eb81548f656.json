Also seeding Season 01.\r\n\r\nAmos Burke was a Los Angeles chief of detectives who was also a millionaire with a chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce, a mansion, and a high-wheeling lifestyle. The hallmarks of this series were glamorous, sophisticated settings, unusual twists on formula homicide plotlines, and big-name guest stars. After a couple of seasons, its format was radically revamped. Burke left the police force and became an agent for US Intelligence. At that point, the show's name changed to &quot;Amos Burke--Secret Agent&quot;. Burke's adventures were briefly revived in 1994, under the original title.\r\n- Written by Marg Baskin &lt;  &gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5262d1c69168a49d44412c7bd6508eb81548f656","amp;dn":"Burke%27s+Law+Season+02+%28Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5262d1c69168a49d44412c7bd6508eb81548f656","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,98,209,198,145,104,164,157,68,65,44,123,214,80,142,184,21,72,246,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
