It was billed as a cast recording for a proposed musical of the same name.\r\n\r\nThe album's storyline is inspired by Broadway theatre, AIDS, eugenics, conspiracy theories, feminism, homosexuality and African American culture. It involves an evil, racist prince/theater critic who creates a disease intended to eradicate African Americans and homosexuals. The disease is tested on prisoners who are turned into &quot;Mammy Nuns&quot; led by the story's narrator, Thing-Fish. The story within a story is a satire of a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant couple, Harry and Rhonda (actually played by Italian-Americans), who attend a play performed by the &quot;Mammy Nuns&quot;, and find themselves confronted with their pasts: Harry presented as a homosexual boy, Rhonda presented as a sex doll brought to life.\r\n\r\nCast:\r\nIke Willis - Thing-Fish\r\nTerry Bozzio - Harry\r\nDale Bozzio - Rhonda\r\nNapoleon Murphy Brock - The Evil Prince\r\nBob Harris - Harry-As-A-Boy\r\nJohnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson - Brown Moses\r\n\r\nThe story was constructed during the recording sessions, which included producing new overdubs for recordings which previously appeared on Zappa's albums â€œZoot Allures, Tinseltown Rebellion, You Are What You Is and Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch.â€\r\n\r\nThing-Fish was initially received poorly by critics, who criticized the use of previously recorded material, but has since been reappraised for its highly satirical content.\r\n  \r\nFrank Zappa's &quot;most controversial, misunderstood, overlooked album&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Zappa\r\n\r\nThing-Fish\r\n\r\n1984\r\n\r\n2012 Reissue\r\n\r\n\r\n2CDs / 2012 VBR-V0\r\n\r\n\r\nTrack List:\r\n\r\nDisc 1:\r\n\r\n1.\tPrologue 2:56 \r\n2.\tThe Mammy Nuns 3:31 \r\n3.\tHarry &amp; Rhonda 3:36 \r\n4.\tGaloot Up-Date 5:27 \r\n5.\tThe 'Torchum' Never Stops 10:33 \r\n6.\tThat Evil Prince 1:17 \r\n7.\tYou Are What You Is 4:31 \r\n8.\tMudd Club 3:17 \r\n9.\tThe Meek Shall Inherit Nothing 3:14 \r\n10.\tClowns On Velvet 1:51 \r\n11.\tHarry-As-A-Boy 2:34 \r\n12.\tHe's So Gay 2:45 \r\n13.\tThe Massive Improve'lence 5:08 \r\n14.\tArtificial Rhonda 3:29 \r\n\r\n\r\nDisc 2:\r\n\r\n1.\tThe Crab-Grass Baby 3:47 \r\n2.\tThe White Boy Troubles 3:34 \r\n3.\tNo Not Now 5:49 \r\n4.\tBriefcase Boogie 4:10 \r\n5.\tBrown Moses 3:00 \r\n6.\tWistful Wit A Fist-Full 4:00 \r\n7.\tDrop Dead 7:56 \r\n8.\tWon Ton On 4:18 \r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Zappa / Thing-Fish / 1984\r\n\r\n\r\n:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41ad8fc081fbd4150cf23d83586c3efd7520a74b","amp;dn":"Frank+Zappa+-+Thing-Fish+%281984%29+2CD+%282012+Reissue%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41ad8fc081fbd4150cf23d83586c3efd7520a74b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,173,143,192,129,251,212,21,12,242,61,131,88,108,62,253,117,32,167,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
