Leading his tribe in the treasure hunt is space-obsessed youth Iskander Orinbekov. Iskander keeps track of blast-offs via his ham radio, calculates the likely drop points and coordinates trade with other tribes. Launching from Baikonur, beautiful French billionaire Julie MahÃ© is amongst the latest batch of wealthy tourists able to pay $20 million for a week's space travel. When Julie falls to earth in a space capsule, Iskander, ahead of the Russian authorities, finds the luminous but comatose cosmonaut and hides her in his yurt.\r\n\r\nA feature film set in the heart of the current Russian space programme and filmed in legendary locations across Russia and Kazakhstan, it is one of the first movies ever shot at Baikonur cosmodrome and contains some stunning pictures from the launchpad. Director Veit Helmer secured authorisations from various Russian agencies for his actors to use genuine cosmonaut training equipment at Star City, including the centrifuge, Soyuz and ISS simulators and the giant tanks used for EVA training.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: DivX5, 704x376, 25.000 fps, 1764 Kbps, 01h30m59s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, 6 channel, 384 kbps\r\nRatio: 1.85:1\r\n\r\nDVDRip, Russian audio with some English and French\r\n\r\nOptional subtitles English, German, Spanish\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/a9gj4hwuj/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/mlgo9qr2j/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/5aq9hpzez/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/i0uhut7d7/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/s8d177tl7/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fbcf2fb0b96e72b54876c3aa0b7d435a977f55c","amp;dn":"Baikonur+-+%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%83%D1%80+%5B2011+-+Kazakhstan%5D+cosmonaut+comedy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fbcf2fb0b96e72b54876c3aa0b7d435a977f55c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,188,242,251,11,150,231,43,84,135,108,58,160,183,212,53,169,119,245,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
