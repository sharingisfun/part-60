This upload is made to make it more easy to create a full node. \r\n\r\n1) Install Bitcoin XT, BU or even Bitcoin Core. \r\n\r\n2) Don't let your wallet/node sync since that is what this torrent is here to help with. Can easily take days. \r\n\r\n3) Download this torrent and replace &quot;blocks&quot; and &quot;chainstate&quot; with your two folders in your install folder. \r\n\r\n4) Now launch your wallet/node and let it sync the last days since 01-01-2016. \r\n\r\nAny questions or mistakes I made. Find me on reddit.\r\n\r\n- /u/FjorXD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af6a8655c60c48404152525ee0daa906945f8a44","amp;dn":"Bitcoin+Blockchain+01-01-2016.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af6a8655c60c48404152525ee0daa906945f8a44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,106,134,85,198,12,72,64,65,82,82,94,224,218,169,6,148,95,138,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
