Haus (WP, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-78242-464-2\r\n\r\nFundamentals and Applications of Nanophotonics includes a comprehensive discussion of the field of nanophotonics, including key enabling technologies that have the potential to drive economic growth and impact numerous application domains such as ICT, the environment, healthcare, military, transport, manufacturing, and energy.\r\n\r\nThis book gives readers the theoretical underpinnings needed to understand the latest advances in the field. After an introduction to the area, chapters two and three cover the essential topics of electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, and computation as they relate to nanophotonics.\r\n\r\nSubsequent chapters explore materials for nanophotonics, including nanoparticles, photonic crystals, nanosilicon, nanocarbon, III-V, and II-VI semiconductors. In addition, fabrication and characterization techniques are addressed, along with the importance of plasmonics, and the applications of nanophotonics in devices such as lasers, LEDs, and photodetectors.\r\n\r\n\r\nCovers electrodynamics, quantum mechanics and computation as these relate to nanophotonics\r\nReviews materials, fabrication and characterization techniques for nanophotonics\r\nDescribes applications of the technology such as lasers, LEDs and photodetectors","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c6fe65aadb2decfc0dd073cb150824822d7bc45","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+and+Applications+of+Nanophotonics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c6fe65aadb2decfc0dd073cb150824822d7bc45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,111,230,90,173,178,222,207,192,221,7,60,177,80,130,72,34,215,188,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
