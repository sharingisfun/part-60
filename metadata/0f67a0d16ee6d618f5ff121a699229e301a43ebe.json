Once designed for high-pressure environments and exploring gas giants and deep space, these mechs have now been modified for war.\r\n\r\nTemplars descend from a Zendu bloodline -- a unique heritage that gives them the ability (with proper training and ritual) to pass all of memories from their lives (and any memories passed down by their ancestors) to a newborn child. This memory gift is known as a Templarâ€™s Lineage â€“ and it is what gives Templars their immense advantage in combat, tactics, engineering, and the ability to drive hulking Leviathan Battle Suits. You will take on the role of a Templar Captain who hails from a storied Lineage reaching back 87 Templars -- and who pages back through the memories to help cope with the dire situation at hand.\r\n\r\nWith the Great Exodus coming to an end, the Star Traders founded new colonies on the few remaining habitable worlds. The Templar Knights are called upon once again to defend the Star Traders and their new colonies from an ancient threat.\r\n\r\n\r\n= WHO WE ARE = \r\nTrese Brothers Games is a premier indie game developer of desktop and mobile RPG and strategy games.
