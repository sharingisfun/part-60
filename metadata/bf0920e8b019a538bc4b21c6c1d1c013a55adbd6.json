She received a BS in electrical engineering from the University of Rhode Island. Her graduate work was completed at Virginia Tech where she received an MS in mathematics and an MS and PhD in electrical engineering. Since 2007, Mellodge has been part of the Samuel I. Ward Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Hartford. With a focus in control systems and automation, she teaches courses in both the engineering and engineering technology programs. She has worked on projects involving control system design, microwave process design and characterization, and modeling of the human balance system. Prior to this appointment, Mellodge studied at Virginia Tech under Pushkin Kachroo with a focus on dynamical system analysis and control theory. Her disser- tation topic involved control system abstraction and its application to mobile robotic control. Also during this time, Mellodge worked in the microwave processing lab in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering on projects involving hardware design for waste remediation and microwave/material interaction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf0920e8b019a538bc4b21c6c1d1c013a55adbd6","amp;dn":"+A+Practical+Approach+to+Dynamical+Systems+for+Engineers+%5BZeo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf0920e8b019a538bc4b21c6c1d1c013a55adbd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,9,32,232,176,25,165,56,188,75,33,198,193,209,192,19,165,90,219,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
