Overthrown dictator's wife Soraya Al Amir tries to start a new, more innocent life right under the flight path in Hounslow, a working-class drama teacher is exasperated by the fact that all her students seem to be posh and OAP sex worker Dora's failing memory causes some career hiccups. Meanwhile, Margaret the ex-Wimbledon line judge unsuccessfully explains how to tolerate grunting in the modern game, and Angela Merkel is back in Britain for another top-level political summit.\r\n\r\nSource: BBC One-HD TS[AVC/AC3] DDD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAVC 1080i &gt; x264 720p (H264 high @L4.1 AVCHD) 2pass approx. 3.4Mbps\r\nAC3 2.0 original stream mux [Dolby Digital]\r\nselectable SRT English CC Subtitles\r\n\r\nSize: 746Mb - 1/6 DVD\r\n\r\nHigh quality encode.\r\n\r\nEnjoy,\r\n\r\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8ea3d7354940b0d9d46f7233bf4a0a408485d8e","amp;dn":"BBC+Tracey+Ullman%27s+Show+2016+S01E04+CC+HDTV+x264+AC3+2.0+720p+m","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8ea3d7354940b0d9d46f7233bf4a0a408485d8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,234,61,115,84,148,11,13,157,70,247,35,59,244,160,164,8,72,93,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
