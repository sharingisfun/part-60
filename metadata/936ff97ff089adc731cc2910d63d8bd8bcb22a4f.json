It contains 12 episodes.  It is a series which was shown, one episode per week, in movie theaters in the 1940s and 1950s to keep the kiddies coming back each week to find out about the cliff hanger.  &quot;Did the hero really die this time???&quot;  Of course, he or she never did.\r\n\r\nIf you like OTS videos, then you must SEED THEM.  \r\n\r\nIf I see a good seed count, then I will know that more are desired and I will post more of the over 130 OTS I have.  If they are downloaded and not seeded, then I will be very slow in posting more since I don't have unlimited bandwidth.  Without seeders' help, it will be a slow go! \r\n\r\nIf you like something, participate in the swarm and SEED!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:936ff97ff089adc731cc2910d63d8bd8bcb22a4f","amp;dn":"Brenda+Starr%2C+Reporter+1945+%28Old+Time+Serial%29++%28OTS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"936ff97ff089adc731cc2910d63d8bd8bcb22a4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,111,249,127,240,137,173,199,49,204,41,16,214,61,139,216,188,178,42,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
