Up today is\r\nthe Rempis/Daisy Duo and their Second Spring (Aerophonic 003). Dave gets a lot\r\nof music out of his alto, tenor and baritone saxophones; Tim Daisy responds in\r\nkind on drums/percussion.\r\n\r\nBoth are key members of a Chicago group of avant jazz musicians who tend to\r\nplay together. We've heard from many of them in various configurations on these\r\npages, but never these two in duo. It usually helps in these intimate\r\nsituations if the players know each other's playing well, if they have spend a\r\ngood deal of time playing together. That's certainly the case with Dave and\r\nTim. The musical sympathies are there to hear in these improvised\r\nsequences. This is free blowing of good provenance--they come from inspired\r\nplaces within and the spirit-feel does not flag. Both show why they are fully\r\nthemselves and in-demand players on the Chicago avant scene.\r\n\r\nSecond Spring showcases Rempis and Daisy in great form. It is a straightforward\r\nblowing romp that gets rolling from the start and does not stop until the last\r\nphrase is played. Check it out and get some good sounds!\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBy Tom Burris \nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2014/01/rempisabramsra-rempisdaisy-duo.html\r\n\r\nBy Derek Taylor\r\n\r\nBy Glenn Astarita \nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/second-spring-dave-rempis-aerophonic-records-review-by-glenn-astarita.php\r\n\r\nGuy Peters (nl) \nhttp://www.enola.be/muziek/albums/23206:the-rempisdaisy-duo--second-spring\r\n\r\nPar Guillaume Belhomme (fr)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e80f20ce6fb7ad9fc282dc6ff47ede7548b5ddef","amp;dn":"The+Rempis-Daisy+Duo+-+Second+Spring+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e80f20ce6fb7ad9fc282dc6ff47ede7548b5ddef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,15,32,206,111,183,173,159,194,130,220,111,244,126,222,117,72,181,221,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
