Building on the improvements to characters, relationships and motivations made in his edits of Episodes I &amp; II, Dawn of the Empire creates a subtle but more realistic and tragic fall from grace for Anakin. This edit provides a more comprehensive and emotionally charged conclusion to the Prequels in preparation for the Original Trilogy.\r\n\r\nIntention:\r\nDawn of the Empire is the combination of multiple, complimentary goals. In the broadest terms my goal was to bring my fanedits of the Prequel Trilogy full circle, maintaining the same principles regarding dialog, pacing and removal of ineffective humor in order to create a tone throughout the PT that is more compatible with the Original Trilogy.\r\n\r\nSecond, I wanted to complete my correction of certain story elements which I felt were in conflict with the OT, particularly flying R2, the title of Darth, and of course the removal of midichlorians.\r\n\r\nLastly, and specific to this edit I wanted to strengthen the story of how Palpatine twists and manipulates Anakin into viewing the Jedi as dishonest, as well as fill out the story with the Birth of the Rebellion deleted scene.\r\n\r\nSpecific to the story of Episode III, my goal was to make Dawn of the Empire a more compelling, tragic and emotionally satisfying take on Revenge of the Sith. In bigger terms, itâ€™s my hope that the totality of the L8wrtr PT will help enhance viewings of the OT by creating more engaging characters that the viewer can care about, so that the OTâ€™s emotional strings have more weight and impact, particularly with the final chapter of Return of the Jedi.\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks:\r\nSPECIAL CONTRIBUTORS :\r\nThis edit would not have been possible but for specific contributions by the following:\r\n\r\nAngel was crucial in providing 3 matte backgrounds critical to restructuring the initial confrontation between Yoda and Palpatine.\r\nQ2 provided critical assistance in the workflow for upscaling the dvd deleted scenes.\r\nnjvc is responsible for the slick menus motion files, static menu images plus tons of further assistance.\r\nRogue-theX worked tirelessly on the cover art, thank you from the bottom of my heart Rogue, you are a true gentleman.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, two editors work served as inspiration and blue-prints for two specific scenes. Their original work deserves recognition:\r\nDark Force Rising by Kerr set the standard for the pivotal scene between Mace, Anakin and Palpatine.\r\nRevenge of the Sith by Corgicar provided the inspiration of Obi-Wanâ€™s fateful victory over Anakin.\r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks:\r\nEveryone at Fanedit.org who contributed to this to the in-the-works thread, you are too many to list year, but watch the credits! Your support and belief in this project were inspiring.\r\n\r\nLastly, and with all sincerity, thank you George. Star Wars is one of the most positive and powerful influences of my childhood.\r\n\r\nRelease Information\r\n* NTSC DVD-5\r\n* NTSC DVD-9\r\n* AVCHD (DVD-9)\r\n* Blu-Ray (BD-25)\r\n\r\nSpecial Features\r\n* Audio Commentary Track (All Release Formats)\r\n* About this fanedit featurette (BD and Dual Layer DVD)\r\n* Trailers (BD and Dual Layer DVD)\r\n \nhttp://fanedit.org/ifdb/component/content/article/79-fanedit-database/fanfix/83-dote","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e3891693a0d28f63243e5e7b565f59eb6d89fe9","amp;dn":"Star+Wars%3A+Episode+III+-+Dawn+of+the+Empire+%28L8wrtr+Fanedit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e3891693a0d28f63243e5e7b565f59eb6d89fe9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,56,145,105,58,13,40,246,50,67,229,231,181,101,245,158,182,216,159,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
