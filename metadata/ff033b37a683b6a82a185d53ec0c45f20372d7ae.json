It's here: https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/13266393 \r\nB (this one):Present (from 1950 onwards) and a separate section for \r\nC: Science Fiction, Fantasy and the like (you'll find Wells, Tolkien, Diana Wynne Jones, Neil Gaiman and J.K.Rowling there). \r\n\r\nThe books are mainly in .epub and .pdf, because I don't own a Kindle and I dislike the very idea of a proprietary format and ereader which binds you as its slave, in exchange for the low price. I usually go for ereaders which support the greatest number of formats. \r\n\r\nMy naming convention is different than found in collections that come from Calibre. I hate it when the books are by book title and not by author, because I want the books by the same author to be shown together even when they are not grouped in a folder.\r\n\r\nSources\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThese are not my own scans or OCR. They have been collected over many years from the web, either from huge messy book torrents containing a bit of everything or one by one from free download sites such as gutenberg, archive org and such; a bunch of them came with my various e-readers. \r\nMy only merit, then, is collecting and organizing them, but I assure you that it was quite a bit of work. I picked those which belong to this category from the chaos of most book torrents, or downloaded the free books one by one. Then I renamed them consistently to prune out doubles and make search easy. Iâ€™ve taken out meaningless folder numbers , deleted .opf and other useless files. In many cases Iâ€™ve added a .txt file with info about authors, added authorâ€™s year of birth and death, or found a book cover when there wasnâ€™t any. \r\n\r\nYou might find some books twice: usually because one is a scan of a regular book and the other one with the blown-up font used for e-readers, or sometimes one will include a cover and the other wonâ€™t. .. things like that. The collection is not compressed, so if these things donâ€™t matter to you, feel free to skip downloading one of the two. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou might also enjoy:\r\nWriting manuals collection - 42 books on the art of writing https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/13266319","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff033b37a683b6a82a185d53ec0c45f20372d7ae","amp;dn":"British+%26amp%3B+Irish+Literature+part+B+-+After+1950","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff033b37a683b6a82a185d53ec0c45f20372d7ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,3,59,55,166,131,182,168,42,24,93,83,236,12,69,242,3,114,215,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
