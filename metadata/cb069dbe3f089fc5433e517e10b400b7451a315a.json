It is based on a 1990 French &amp; Saunders sketch created by Saunders and Dawn French.\r\n\r\nThe series features Saunders as Edina Monsoon, a heavy-drinking, drug-abusing PR agent who spends her time chasing bizarre fads in a desperate attempt to stay young and &quot;hip&quot;. Edina is joined in her quest by magazine editor Patsy Stone (played by Joanna Lumley), her best friend and enabler, whose drug abuse, alcohol consumption, and promiscuity far eclipse Edina's comparatively mild self-destructive behaviour. Despite being a middle-aged, twice-divorced career woman, Edina is reliant upon the support of her daughter Saffron (Julia Sawalha), a secondary school pupil (and later university student) whose constant care of her mother has left her a bitter cynic. The series also stars June Whitfield and Jane Horrocks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb069dbe3f089fc5433e517e10b400b7451a315a","amp;dn":"Absolutely+Fabulous+-+Extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb069dbe3f089fc5433e517e10b400b7451a315a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,6,157,190,63,8,159,197,67,62,81,126,16,180,0,183,69,26,49,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
