Plus it didn't have screwed up colors and by all accounts it had a pretty awesome sound mix (unlike the screwed up DVD and BD mixes) which we now have in the highest quality as heard in cinemas in 1997, thanks to Jetrell Fo and CapableMetal, who extracted it from the original theatrical DTS discs and dark_jedi, who synced it and encoded a DTS-HD track from it.\r\n\r\nIt is a side project to the Despecialized Edition - it uses the Despecialized Edition v2.5 master as its main video source and puts the changes made in 1997 back in, mostly using the Blu-Ray version and in case of 1997 changes, which were redone in later versions, this version combines the BD footage with Team Blu's (Dark Jedi and You_Too) 1997 version.\r\n\r\nThe color correction is still based on a fade free 1977 I.B. Technicolor Print, just as the 1997 version supposedly was. The forced subtitles in the Greedo scene were left the same as in v2.5 and the subtitles in the Jabba scene (along with the rest of the 1997 elements of the footage were used from the Team Blu version).\r\n\r\nHere are some screenshots: http://postimg.org/gallery/cfmct944/\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nVIDEO SOURCES:\r\n\r\n1) STAR WARS Despecialized Edition v2.5\r\n\r\n2) STAR WARS Episode IV A New Hope Official Blu-Ray 2011 (Preliminary colour correction by You_Too)\r\n\r\n3) Star.Wars.Episode.IV.A.New.Hope.1977.720p.HDTV.x264-DON (2004 DVD Version)\r\n\r\n4) STAR WARS 2006 Bonus DVD (sourced from the 1993 Definitive Edition Laser Disc Master - upscales by Dark Jedi, You_Too and Harmy)\r\n\r\n5) STAR WARS 1997 Special Edition (Reivax DTV capture)\r\n\r\n6) STAR WARS 1997 Special Edition (Team Blu version)\r\n\r\n7) Custom mattes, film-cell scans etc.\r\n\r\n8) Puggo Grande (1977 16mm print transfer)\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTechnical Specifications:\r\n\r\nFORMAT: MKV\r\n\r\nSIZE: 10.7 GB\r\n\r\nVIDEO: 1280x540 H.264 23.976 fps\r\n\r\nAUDIO:\r\n1) English 5.1 1997 Theatrical DTS (DTS-HD) (by Jetrell Fo &amp; CapableMetal &amp; Dark_Jedi)\r\n2) English 5.1 1997 Laserdisc Dolby Digital (AC3) (by Schorman13)\r\n3) English 2.0 1997 Laserdisc LPCM (Flac) (by Schorman13)\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe ISO image can be burned to a DVD-DL and should work in most Blu-Ray players.\r\n\r\nTo burn, you can use image burn following thse instructions: http://onlineitpro.com/?p=181","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9393253665259deb7e1e8e30894d8f9d0caf7ac0","amp;dn":"Harmy%27s+Star+Wars+-+Respecialized+Edition+%2797","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9393253665259deb7e1e8e30894d8f9d0caf7ac0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,147,37,54,101,37,157,235,126,30,142,48,137,77,143,157,12,175,122,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
