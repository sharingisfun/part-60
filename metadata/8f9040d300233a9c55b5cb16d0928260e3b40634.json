Stephen F. Cohen, NYU. Princeton University. EastWestAccord.com\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€¦Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet premier, says that he supports Russian President Vladimir Putinâ€™s takeover in Crimea â€” and that he would have done the same if heâ€™d had the chance.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe once-powerful leader, now 85 and in poor health, spoke in an interview with the Sunday Times of London.\r\n\r\nâ€œIâ€™m always with the free will of the people and most in Crimea wanted to be reunited with Russia,â€ Gorbachev said.\r\n\r\nPutin seized the peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014 following a chaotic pro-Western uprising.\r\n\r\nâ€œGorbachev, who is releasing a memoir, has criticized Putin for retaining power for more than 15 years and for clamping down on protesters.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe always had normal relations,â€ he said of his relationship with Putin, who has also served as prime minister. â€œNow, I wouldnâ€™t describe them as normal. We have no relations.â€â€¦\r\n \nhttp://nypost.com/2016/05/22/gorbachev-backs-putins-invasion-of-crimea/\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show\t \nhttp://johnbatchelorshow.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f9040d300233a9c55b5cb16d0928260e3b40634","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+Stephen+F+Cohen+Lamentations+Gorbachev.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f9040d300233a9c55b5cb16d0928260e3b40634","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,144,64,211,0,35,58,156,85,181,203,22,208,146,130,96,227,180,6,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
