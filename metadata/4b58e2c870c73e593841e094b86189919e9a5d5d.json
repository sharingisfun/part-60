You can do so on the Pirate Bay through the comments section on this torrent, or on KickAss torrents you can of course message me.\r\n\r\nPlease mention the part number you wish me to re seed and I will do so overnight local time.   Slow downloads will not be accommodated as that is simply down to bad torrent techniques.   Everyone can download at decent speeds if they learn how to torrent and STOP overloading there bit torrent client with dozens of active downloads and seeds!!!!\r\n\r\n300 more CDG+MP3 Karaoke classic songs for you.
