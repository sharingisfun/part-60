He returned to the band for a 2-year reunion from 2003 to 2005. \r\n\r\nOn March 12, 2007, Hagar was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Van Halen. \r\nHis musical style primarily consists of hard rock and heavy metal.\r\nOutside of music, he founded the Cabo Wabo Tequila brand and restaurant chain, as well as Sammy's Beach Bar Rum.\r\n\r\nHis present musical project is lead singer of Chickenfoot.\r\n\r\nVOA is the last solo album released by Sammy Hagar before he joined Van Halen. \r\nIt is also his eight solo studio album. \r\nAt around the same time, guitarist Gary Pihl joined Boston. The title is a reference to the Voice of America broadcast network. \r\nThis was one of a string of albums that each one was as good or better than the last. \r\nThen Van Halen came a calling having somehow survived the Gary Cherrone fiasco.\r\n\r\n\r\nYear:\t1984\r\n\r\nStyle:\tHard Rock\r\n\r\nCountry: USA\r\n\r\nFormat:\t320 mp3\r\n\r\nSize:\t84.93 MB\r\n\r\n\t\r\nAdded:\t12/27/2015 \r\n\r\nFiles:\t10\r\n\r\nDescription:\t\r\n\r\nLength : 0:36:39\r\n\r\n\r\nTrack listing\r\n\r\n    &quot;I Can't Drive 55&quot; (Sammy Hagar) - 4:12\r\n    &quot;Swept Away&quot; (Hagar) - 5:36\r\n    &quot;Rock Is in My Blood&quot; (Hagar) - 4:29\r\n    &quot;Two Sides of Love&quot; (Hagar) - 3:41\r\n    &quot;Dick in the Dirt&quot; (Hagar) - 4:19\r\n    &quot;VOA&quot; (Hagar) - 4:29\r\n    &quot;Don't Make Me Wait&quot; (Hagar/Jesse Harms) - 4:06\r\n    &quot;Burnin' Down the City&quot; (Hagar) - 5:32\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel\r\n\r\n    Sammy Hagar: lead vocals, lead guitar\r\n    Gary Pihl: rhythm guitar, backing vocals\r\n    Jesse Harms: keyboards, backing vocals\r\n    Bill Church: bass guitar, backing vocals\r\n    David Lauser: drums, backing vocals\r\n    Ted &quot;Champagne&quot; Templeman: percussion\r\n\r\nOther personnel\r\n\r\n    Ted Templeman: producer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3b140c79da7791660f678fbd534a24e8802d131","amp;dn":"Sammy+Hagar+-+V.O.A.+1984+320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3b140c79da7791660f678fbd534a24e8802d131","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,177,64,199,157,167,121,22,96,246,120,251,213,52,162,78,136,2,209,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
