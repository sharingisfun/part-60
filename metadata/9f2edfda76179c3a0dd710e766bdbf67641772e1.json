Lana Del Rey . The 24-year-old New York native may be a relative unknown who is yet to officially release any music but such is the emotional resonance of her velvety, dulcet tones we reckon youâ€™ll be hearing much more from her in the months and years to come. Born in the rural town of Lake Placid in New York State, Lana spent her formative years moving between Alabama, New Jersey and New York City before more recently relocating to London.\r\n\r\nAlbums span from various years, please comment, rate, and seed if you enjoyed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f2edfda76179c3a0dd710e766bdbf67641772e1","amp;dn":"Lana+Del+Rey+-+Discography+2005+-+2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f2edfda76179c3a0dd710e766bdbf67641772e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,46,223,218,118,23,156,58,13,215,16,231,102,189,191,103,100,23,114,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
