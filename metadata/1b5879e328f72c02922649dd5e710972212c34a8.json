It accurately reflects the essence of the team. Aella (translation: â€œwhirlwindâ€) is a name one of the five harpies of Greek mythology. And, by a happy coincidence - the same name had the leader of the Amazons, challenge yourself to Hercules! After all, most of the songs â€œAELLAâ€ traditionally dedicated to strong women (Catherine the Great), young girls (Night Witches) of the 46th Regiment of the flight, and burned at the stake â€œhereticsâ€ and â€œwitchesâ€ and other congenial already lyrical characters. Girls began their career as a cover project, performing best songs of such groups as the Rainbow, Royal Hunt, Helloween, Yngwie Malmsteen etc. However, not long in coming their own material. In May 2011, saw the release of the first album of the same name - â€œAellaâ€œ - recorded in the â€œnativeâ€ studio KIV Records and, as subsequent published on the label CD-Maximum. In addition, 10 April 2014, the band released the album â€œAella Garageâ€ with cover versions of songs favorite classics of rock music: Rainbow, Deep Purple, Helloween and Doro (Warlock). The album â€œNight Witchesâ€œ, released December 31, 2013, marked the transition to the new sound of the group, which clearly manifested elements of neo-classical and progressive. The basic elements - melody of the songs, the richness of the arrangements - remained the same. Aella is now working on another album, not forgetting to give concerts throughout Russia and to share with the audience a strong male energy of Metal in conjunction with the female charm of AELLA's staff.\r\n\r\nCurrent Line-up:\r\nTillen Avers - Vocals\r\nOlga Andreeva - Lead Guitar\r\nOlga Volodkina - Guitar\r\nNatalya Pereverzeva - Bass\r\nTatiana Lepskaya - Keyboards\r\nEkaterina Sorokina - Drums\r\n\r\nAlex Martin - Team Leader\r\n\r\nmore info: \nhttp://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Aella/3540328850","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b5879e328f72c02922649dd5e710972212c34a8","amp;dn":"AELLA+%5B2009-2015%5D+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b5879e328f72c02922649dd5e710972212c34a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,88,121,227,40,247,44,2,146,38,73,221,94,113,9,114,33,44,52,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
