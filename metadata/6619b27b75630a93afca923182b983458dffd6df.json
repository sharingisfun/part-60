In it, he claims American political system was reformed to death, and that the effects of transparency and openness in government has undermined the elites who prevent political insanity.\r\n\r\n Trump's Job Pitch Sounds Like a Good Way to Win the WH\r\nNew York Post - John Crudele\r\nIt wasn't fancy, but it was the most important line of Donald Trump's shockingly captivating speech yesterday. It's also the modern version of Bill Clinton's rallying cry from 1992, a reminder to himself that: &quot;It's the economy, stupid!&quot;\r\n\r\n Brexit Will Be Britain's Fourth of July\r\nThe Daily Beast - Joel Kotkin\r\nThe campaign to take the United Kingdom out of the European Union, widely known as &quot;Brexit,&quot; is potentially on the verge of a huge victory Thursday despite overwhelming opposition in the media and among the corporate and political establishment. The outcome matters not just as an expression of arcane British insularity, but as evidence of a growing rebellion against the ever greater consolidation and concentration of power now occurring across all of Europe, as well as here in the United States.\r\n \nhttp://www.lauraingraham.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6619b27b75630a93afca923182b983458dffd6df","amp;dn":"Laura+Ingraham+June+23+2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6619b27b75630a93afca923182b983458dffd6df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,25,178,123,117,99,10,147,175,202,146,49,130,185,131,69,141,255,214,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
