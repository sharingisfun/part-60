The band were formed in 1989 and disbanded in 1994.\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\nRTZ began as a collaboration between Boston members Brad Delp and Barry Goudreau around 1989. The original 1987 demo of &quot;Face The Music&quot; (featuring Fergie Frederiksen on vocals) was later made available for download at BarryGoudreau.com. Goudreau and Delp were both part of the original Boston line-up and after Goudreau's departure from the band, they stayed in close contact with Delp contributing to Goudreau's solo album and also to a lesser degree on the Orion the Hunter album.\r\n\r\nFor more info, see the Wikipedia article - I hate to copy/paste others' info.\r\n\r\nLet's just say you could NOT go out today and get this album in ANY form. It went out of print after the first pressing and has never been re-released, although some of the tracks can be found on later compilation albums.\r\n\r\nIn 2007 we lost Brad Delp and the best rock and roll voice I personally EVER heard. This is being posted as a tribute to &quot;The Nicest Guy In Rock and Roll&quot; as he was regarded by his peers. Rest in Peace Brad!\r\n\r\nNativeSonKY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a48d133bf19fa0ff5766c5be8d791400fcfc18db","amp;dn":"RTZ+-++Zero+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a48d133bf19fa0ff5766c5be8d791400fcfc18db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,141,19,59,241,159,160,255,87,102,197,190,141,121,20,0,252,252,24,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
