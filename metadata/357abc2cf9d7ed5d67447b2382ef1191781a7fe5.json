F. Hewitt and N. S. Hall-Taylor (Pergamon, 1970).pdf\r\n\r\nAnnular Two-Phase Flow presents the wide range of industrial applications of annular two-phase flow regimes. This book discusses the fluid dynamics and heat transfer aspects of the flow pattern.\r\nOrganized into 12 chapters, this book begins with an overview of the classification of the various types of interface distribution observed in practice. This text then examines the various regimes of two-phase flow with emphasis on the regions of occurrence of the annular flow regime. Other chapters consider the single momentum and energy balances, which illustrate the differences and analogies between single- and two-phase flows. This book discusses as well the simple modes for annular flow with consideration to the calculation of the profile of shear stress in the liquid film. The final chapter deals with the techniques that are developed for the measurement of flow pattern, entrainment, and film thickness.\r\nThis book is a valuable resource for chemical engineers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:357abc2cf9d7ed5d67447b2382ef1191781a7fe5","amp;dn":"Annular+Two-Phase+Flow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"357abc2cf9d7ed5d67447b2382ef1191781a7fe5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,122,188,44,249,215,237,93,103,68,123,35,130,239,17,145,120,26,127,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
