Ant admits he needs to lighten up a bit, Joe DeVito joins the party to chat about David Bowie, the Golden Globes, shitty award shows, shitty variety shows, shitty styles, hot chicks on old TV, Sean Penn, El Chapo, and Ricky Gervais and Mel Gibson at the Golden Globes. We watch the footage from El Chapoâ€™s raid, the guys discuss corrupt cops and military, drug mules, court experiences, old â€œedgyâ€ sitcoms, rapefugees, accepting rape as part of a culture, apologetic liberals, people attempting to go viral, we get some Sweden/refugee/rape stats from callers, and they talk about justification for the sake of diversity. After a few more callers, Ant and Joe talk about â€œMaking a Murderer,â€ John Wayne on I Love Lucy, John Wayneâ€™s cancerous film, racist TV and movie roles, Miloâ€™s (Nero) Twitter punishment, social media flagging, on-line ignorance, bullying, and Powerball.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adc2df88075700ced4420dd4e00e1153e8c288ff","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2016-01-11+Joe+DeVito+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adc2df88075700ced4420dd4e00e1153e8c288ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,194,223,136,7,87,0,206,212,66,13,212,224,14,17,83,232,194,136,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
