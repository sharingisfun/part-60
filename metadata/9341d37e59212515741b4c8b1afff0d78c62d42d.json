He was 83. \r\n\r\nThis duet set by pianist Paul Bley and guitarist Sonny Greenwich, after two melodic solos by Greenwich and Bley's feature on &quot;Arrival,&quot; becomes a loose bop session. &quot;Meandering&quot; is a blues and, in the tradition of Lennie Tristano, the origins of the originals &quot;Willow&quot; and &quot;You Are&quot; are not too difficult to figure out. \r\n\r\nThe music does meander a bit but mostly swings in a floating way. Although there are some freer moments, this is as straight as Paul Bley has played on records in years and Sonny Greenwich also sounds fairly conservative, at least if one does not listen too closely. It's a relaxed and very interesting set.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - Sonics II\r\n02 - Horizons\r\n03 - Arrival\r\n04 - Now\r\n05 - Meandering\r\n06 - Willow\r\n07 - I Remember Harlem\r\n08 - Peel Street Blues\r\n09 - Steeplechase\r\n10 - You Are\r\n11 - These Foolish Things\r\n12 - Pent Up House\r\n\r\n*1995 Justin Time Records | Just 69-2\r\n\r\n\r\nRecorded at Studio Tempo, Montreal, Canada July 8, 1994\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nPaul Bley - piano\r\nSonny Greenwich - guitar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9341d37e59212515741b4c8b1afff0d78c62d42d","amp;dn":"Paul+Bley+%26amp%3B+Sonny+Greenwich+-+Outside+In+%281994%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9341d37e59212515741b4c8b1afff0d78c62d42d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,65,211,126,89,33,37,21,116,27,76,139,26,255,240,215,140,98,212,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
