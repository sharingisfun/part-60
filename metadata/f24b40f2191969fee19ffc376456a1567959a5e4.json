GordonGChang, Daily Beast. Peter Navarro, author, â€œCrouching Tiger: What Chinaâ€™s Militarism Means for the World.â€ Rick Fisher, IAASC.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) has proposed the construction of a network of ship and subsurface sensors that could significantly erode the undersea warfare advantage held by US and Russian submarines and contribute greatly to future Chinese ability to control the South China Sea (SCS).\r\n\r\nâ€œDetails of the network of sensors, called the 'Underwater Great Wall Project', were revealed in a CSSC booth at a public exhibition in China in late 2015. A translated copy of the descriptions was obtained by IHS Jane's from a government official. The text was confirmed by a source from a second government on condition of anonymity.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhile some elements of this network have been known for some time, CSSC is now in effect proposing an improved Chinese version of the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) that for a time gave the US a significant advantage in countering Soviet submarines during the Cold War. The system proposed by CSSC is likely being obtained by China's People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) but may also be offered for exportâ€¦.â€\r\n \nhttp://www.janes.com/article/60388/china-proposes-underwater-great-wall-that-could-erode-us-russian-submarine-advantages\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show\t \nhttp://johnbatchelorshow.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f24b40f2191969fee19ffc376456a1567959a5e4","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+Undersea+Wall+of+China.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f24b40f2191969fee19ffc376456a1567959a5e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,75,64,242,25,25,105,254,225,159,252,55,100,86,161,86,121,89,165,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
