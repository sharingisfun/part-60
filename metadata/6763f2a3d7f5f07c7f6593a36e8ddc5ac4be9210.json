Enjoy...\r\n\r\nP/S: i wonder why developers add bright, contrast etc.. basic functions in almost every device, must be pretty hard for some people to use such tools. watermarks are there because its chinese source and i don't blame them.\r\n\r\nVideo: AVC 1900kbps 2Pass-HQ\r\nResolution: 720x400\r\nAudio: Mp3 2.0 Digital Audio thx m8\r\nLanguage: English\r\nSubtitles: none\r\nWatermarks: none from me\r\nSource: Mp4ba720pTC Thx\r\nSample: included\r\nEncoder: CPG","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6763f2a3d7f5f07c7f6593a36e8ddc5ac4be9210","amp;dn":"The+Angry+Birds+Movie+2016+V2+HD-TC+x264+AC3-CPG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6763f2a3d7f5f07c7f6593a36e8ddc5ac4be9210","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,99,242,163,215,245,240,124,127,101,147,163,110,141,220,90,196,190,146,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
