Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nGuest: Joe Matarese\r\n\r\nEpisode 295: Anthony tells us about seeing the movie â€œThe Big Shortâ€ and â€œBlack Mass,â€ gets into the David Bowie/social media effect, Bowie on Ricky Gervaisâ€™s show, and Bowieâ€™s last video. Joe Matarese takes a seat to chat with Ant about Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Robert Romanus, dream interviews, shitty interviews, Rupert Pupkin, Donald Trump, Prince Moulay Hassan, overly affectionate folks, and Joe tells us about taking his kid to see Star Wars. The guys then talk about getting viruses of the computer variety, TV on-line, the TV version of Fast Times at Ridgemont High, deleted scenes, editing comedy, roasting, bombing, the sale of the Playboy Mansion, awkward dad moments, Cali life, awful hairdos, hair plugs, shooting guns, and impressing chicks. The day wraps by discussing gun scenes in movies, East Side Daveâ€™s network premiere, copyright infringement, sound-alike songs, diversification being â€œcrazy racist,â€ tards on TV, and Joey Lawrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94e2050083a2d5f78a4e777fc0b257e6fa8f217f","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2016-01-12+Joe+Matarese+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94e2050083a2d5f78a4e777fc0b257e6fa8f217f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,226,5,0,131,162,213,247,138,78,119,127,192,178,87,230,250,143,33,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
