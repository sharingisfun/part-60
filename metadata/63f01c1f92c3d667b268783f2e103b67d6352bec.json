Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot; politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nGuests: Joe DeVito, Frank D'Angelo\r\n\r\nEpisode 306: TACS brand new week kicks off with Antâ€™s review of last nightâ€™s â€œGrease Live,â€ projections on tonightâ€™s Iowa caucus as well as wtf caucus even means, we see a (dead) â€œwinnerâ€ from a Loverboy video, and pay tribute to Abe Vigoda with an old sketch. We watch a cringe worthy video from the O&amp;A days, see a badass cop do some movie shit during a hostage situation, Sarah Palin laying down the law, Joe DeVito pops in to chat about TV and movie watching, musical theatre, being famous (not) from your town, the negatives of Twitter, and Kurt Metzger awesomely trolling on Twitter. Frank D'Angelo takes a seat to talk about social media, being Sicilian, James Caan, his movie â€œSicilian Vampire,â€ Grease Live, one gazillion dollars in Canada, locations becoming characters, and James Caanâ€™s favorite joke. We find out about Frankâ€™s singing career, the guys talk about Canada, Loverboy, The Eagles, Abe Vigoda, asshole movie characters, Quentin Tarantino, film suggestions, movie trailers, De Niro and Pacino, shitty gigs, and haunting people. Ending the show, Ant, Joe, and Frank yap about the supernatural, fending for yourself, animal dicks (not like that), cat videos, crazy birds, rude cats, evolution, and animal senses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63f01c1f92c3d667b268783f2e103b67d6352bec","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2016-02-01+Joe+DeVito+Frank+D%27Angelo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63f01c1f92c3d667b268783f2e103b67d6352bec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,240,28,31,146,195,214,103,178,104,120,63,46,16,59,103,214,53,43,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
