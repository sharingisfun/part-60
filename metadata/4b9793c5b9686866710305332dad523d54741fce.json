The reason is the flock has been more likely mislead into following a paganized Christanity - Tammuz, Ezekiel 8:44, Jeremiah 44:17-25, from the Babylonian Mystery religion, Revelation 17:5.www.toolong.com , www.wyattmuseum.com , www.davidrives.com\r\n\r\nThis widespread calamity may be best summed up in Jude 1:15-19; \r\n(15) &quot;To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him. (16) These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage. \r\n\r\n(17) But, beloved, REMEMBER ye the words which were SPOKEN BEFORE of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; (18) How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts. (19) These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.&quot; \r\n\r\nThanks to Richard Rives we can see how the Devil subtly deceives unwary humans into following a different Gospel than the one Jesus Christ gave us. Mr. Rives helps us to open our eyes to Satan's incredible deceptions in using the very name of Christ. Spiritual warfare is our Christian mission not conformity to a pagan beliefs embraced by the church. God expects us to prove all things about Bible doctrines and churches to see if they are in the truths of God, John 14:6, 1 Thessalonians 5:14-24.

Those of us who take belief in the God of the Bible seriously feel burdened by the problems that arise in our increasingly secular, pluralistic society. People are abandoning truth, Western culture is dying, and the lines between right and wrong are becoming irrevocably blurred.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this event is to allow two prominent voices in the public square -- one Jewish (Prager), and one evangelical Christian (Ravi) -- to engage in an open, honest and entertaining dialogue about these challenges we face as a nation and civilization. This is about asking and answering tough questions in a God-honoring and purposeful way.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe Ten Virgins:\r\n119 Ministries presents the biblical understanding for the ten virgins parable found in scipture. The parable of the ten virgins is a passionate subject with those who desire to study Biblical end times. Many are often left with the question, &quot;What does this mean?&quot; ...or we assume we know what it means. In this study, we simplify the parable, by allowing the Bible to literally interpret the Bible.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the companion presentation to &quot;The gods of Babylon&quot;. We strongly recommend you watch that presentation first, to gain the essential foundation you will need for this presentation.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to comment on or ask a question about anything in this video, please feel free to contact us, we would be happy to hear from you:\r\nwebsite: www.sureword.co.uk\r\nemail:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b9793c5b9686866710305332dad523d54741fce","amp;dn":"The+Bible+-+Walking+by+Faith+in+the+Armory+of+Truth+pt1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b9793c5b9686866710305332dad523d54741fce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,151,147,197,185,104,104,102,113,3,5,51,45,173,82,61,84,116,31,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
