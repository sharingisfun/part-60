Braden: Ammara\r\nE-book in three formats: ePub, PDF, Mobi.\r\nGenre: inspirational adventure novel, science-fiction novel\r\nPublished in ebook in 2015.\r\n\r\nBLURB:\r\nThe legend of ascension. An uplifting adventure novel the author of which went through a near-death experience in order to write it. Join Professor Robert Lance in his thrilling journey to investigate the final mystery of mankind, just to turn the world upside down in the end.\r\n\r\nContrary to what you might expect from an adventure novel, Ammara gives you profound thoughts and philosophy that you may as well apply to your life and get functional answers to such great questions as â€œWho am I? Why am I here?â€\r\nWhat it will also give you is a real way out of the current evolutionist or excessively religious views of the world along with a special power that changes you.\r\n\r\nDiscover how the Hungarian author packed all of that into an exciting, fascinating narrative in the first book of the Ammara trilogy!\r\n\r\nWEBSITE: http://www.ammarathebook.com/\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR BIOGRAPHY\r\nHoward L. Braden belongs to a strange species. Going through a near-death experience in his adolescence, the Hungarian author was forced to think outside the box forever.\r\nHe did not talk about the experience for years, he just kept working silently. In 2011, he finally decided to speak out: in the form of a spiritual adventure novel. \r\nHis voluntary mission is to pass this legacy on to his readers: his thoughts about life, the human being, the force and something far beyond. \r\n\r\nA BOOK REVIEWS FROM READERS' FAVORITE\r\nAnne-Marie Reynolds\t\r\nAmmara: The Awakening by Howard L. Braden is a novel of the future. Professor Robert Lance leads a happy life until his wife Jenny is killed in a car accident. After that, he goes through the motions of living until one day he is called on by the US Air Force at the college where he teaches. After signing a confidentiality paper, he is taken to Area 51 where his life takes a startling turn and he embarks on a journey he will never forget; a journey to unravel the last mystery left to mankind. What happens in the beginning is the key to the end, a key that is about to turn the world on its axis and leave us wondering who we are and even, perhaps, where we are.\r\n\r\nAmmara: The Awakening by Howard L. Braden was interesting, to say the least. I believe it is the first of a trilogy and, although a long book, was packed with action and adventure right from the very first chapter. It was one of those books that never let up, never went stale, and never left me feeling as though something was missing. This is an extremely well developed book, with a really good background and well-written characters, the type that you can identify with. I was a little confused with how the first chapter fitted in as it seemed to have no bearing on the story, but it all became clear as everything melded together in one amazing, hard to put down tale. Looking forward to the next one!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a14f7dca5531026c03ba3e54373539ec148c1e1d","amp;dn":"Howard+L.+Braden+-+Ammara","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a14f7dca5531026c03ba3e54373539ec148c1e1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,79,125,202,85,49,2,108,3,186,62,84,55,53,57,236,20,140,30,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
