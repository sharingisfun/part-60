One of the founders was ex-drummer (in period 1975-76) of the German band Scorpions - Rudy Lenners. At first, band plays sounds which was a mixture from rogue-side of rage hard rock, R'n'R and proto-punk, next their timbre was evolved to the heavy metal style. The first-half of '80s it was a time, when born and grows of European speed metal Scene, and many events and gigs connected with this Scene was placed in Belgium, Netherlands, UK and Germany - where band mostly exists as plays some gigs and concerts, and influences of this new style of metal slowly starting permeating to their music. In late 1985, young blond-hair emale-vocalist Dani Klein (who later became world famous with her band Vaja Con Dios) was joined to band, and in 1986 they recorded album with Her. Due to this move, their timbre was a little change again, to the mixture of a soft-speed metal with influences of classic heavy metal and melodic hard rock. Unfortunately, because for many market-difficulties and also problems inside the band, this album was never officialy released - band was split-up and never again was plays together....\r\n\r\nmore info: \nhttp://www.spirit-of-metal.com/groupe-groupe-Steelover-l-en.html \nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Steelover","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f79ce83360ef9d4a727d9ffaf7e3d703ccb95e11","amp;dn":"STEELOVER+-+Discography+%2A1984-1986%2A+%5BMP3%40320%2B192%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f79ce83360ef9d4a727d9ffaf7e3d703ccb95e11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,156,232,51,96,239,157,74,114,125,159,250,247,227,215,3,204,185,94,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
