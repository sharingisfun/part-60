Recommend download from a mirror site, such as nluug:  \nhttp://ftp.nluug.nl/os/Linux/distr/quirky/quirky6/amd64/releases/werewolf-7.4/ \r\nThen run the installer. \r\n\r\nBugs \r\nThere are a couple I know of: \r\n\r\n1. Xine hangs. I switched over from VLC as XINE plays my video test files much better. However, if XINE is closed via the menu, it leaves behind a zombie process that cannot be killed, and even prevents shutdown! \r\nAlways close XINE by clicking the close-box at top-right of window. \r\nIf anyone can figure that one out, please do! \r\n\r\n2. If you use the installer to do a full install to a partition, at first bootup a popup message tells you that you have booted from a live-CD. Harmless message, just an annoyance, and I will fix it. \r\n\r\nFeedback \r\nPlease go to this thread in the Puppy Forum, for all bug reports and discussion:  \nhttp://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?p=876263#876263 \r\n\r\nExtra notes \r\nI have only released a 64-bit build, so Quirky will not run on some early Pentium CPUs that are 32-bit only.\r\n\r\nRef:\r\n \nhttp://barryk.org/news/?viewDetailed=00299","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b7ae615e4ee58df2a60ac49b68a26446b8c4025","amp;dn":"Puppy_Linux_Quirky_Werewolf64-7.4.iso_10-Dec-2015+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b7ae615e4ee58df2a60ac49b68a26446b8c4025","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,122,230,21,228,238,88,223,42,96,172,73,182,138,38,68,107,140,64,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
