But when she is contacted by a group who are convinced of Ben's innocence, Libby starts to ask questions she never dared to before. Was the voice she heard her brother's? Ben was a misfit in their small town, but was he capable of murder? Are there secrets to uncover at the family farm or is Libby deluding herself because she wants her brother back?\r\n\r\nShe begins to realise that everyone in her family had something to hide that day... especially Ben. Now, twenty-four years later, the truth is going to be even harder to find.\r\n\r\nWho did massacre the Day family?\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Rebecca Lowman, Cassandra Campbell, Mark Deakins\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 160 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8929343db1982e81976f2c428d95c545dacf0dd0","amp;dn":"Gillian+Flynn+-+Dark+Places","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8929343db1982e81976f2c428d95c545dacf0dd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,41,52,61,177,152,46,129,151,111,44,66,141,149,197,69,218,207,13,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
