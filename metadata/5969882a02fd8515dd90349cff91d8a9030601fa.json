My system reserved partition was full and of course windows update could no longer work, so I had to take the PC off line and sort it, which involved a major Windows 10 update and many reboots before I could get back to seeding, then my Internet went down due to bad weather my end.\r\n\r\nEverything is now fixed and I can seed this latest parts at 7.62 megabits per second once more to the first lucky peer who comes along.   Trouble is of course once there are 13 or 14 peers and still only one seed, things get a little slower.\r\n\r\nWhen that happens I use super seeding, where I hide as a fellow peer in the swarm and give each peer a unique bit to help get things going again and reach the point where peers in the swarm can turn into seeds more quickly.\r\n\r\nSo now you know.  I bet you are so glad I told you ;-)\r\n\r\nRigmar Radio - Rockin' the Free World since 1967","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5969882a02fd8515dd90349cff91d8a9030601fa","amp;dn":"Rigmar+Radio+Karaoke+Collection+32300","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5969882a02fd8515dd90349cff91d8a9030601fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,105,136,42,2,253,133,21,221,144,52,156,255,145,216,169,3,6,1,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
