It was developed by Gordon E. Perrigard, a Canadian medical doctor who combined his knowledge of advanced ju-jitsu with his knowledge of human anatomy to come up with this devastatingly effective close-in combat system.Arwrology was originally released in 1943 in Canada for use in training combatants for World War II.
