The second half of the book deals with compounds responsible for odour, taste and colour that determine the sensory quality of food materials and foods. It further includes chapters devoted to antinutritional, toxic and other biologically active substances, food additives and contaminants.\r\n\r\nStudents, teachers and food technologists will find this book an essential reference on detailed information about the changes and reactions that occur during food processing and storage and possibilities how to manage them. Nutritionists and those who are interested in healthy nutrition will find information about nutrients, novel foods, organic foods, nutraceuticals, dietary supplements, antinutritional factors, food additives and contaminants","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8097228989bb9c2ba562201dae1ce281455efada","amp;dn":"The+Chemistry+of+Food+-+Jan+Velisek","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8097228989bb9c2ba562201dae1ce281455efada","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,151,34,137,137,187,156,43,165,98,32,29,174,28,226,129,69,94,250,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
