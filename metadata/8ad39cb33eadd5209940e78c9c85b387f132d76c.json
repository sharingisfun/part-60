The groove is a combination of\r\nsample loops taken from the Dancity sample collection. Other collections will be\r\nmade available which you may use with this software. The GrooveMaker gives\r\nyou a random access 8 track player allowing you to insert and remove loops in\r\nreal time. The loops are taken from groups called songs and all the loops within a\r\nsong can be recombined in endless ways to produce the groove you want. On top\r\nof this you can insert a useful arpeggiator to be used live for a unique rave\r\nperformance. Grooves can be easily saved and sequenced allowing you to make\r\nyour own compositions with just a few mouse clicks and without specific musical\r\ntraining. A virtual DJ is also included to generate millions of different remix sets.\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\nMinimum: each MacintoshTM Power PC with hard-disk SCSI, 16MB ram, 256-\r\ncolors\r\nmonitor 640x480, double speed CD-ROM drive, at least multi-media quality\r\nspeakers, 50MB free on hard-disk.\r\nRecommended (for high quality real time play): minimum MacintoshTM Power\r\nPC 601, 100Mhz with hard-disk SCSI, 32MB ram, 256-colors monitor 800x600,\r\nquadruple speed CD-ROM drive, high quality speakers, 90MB free on hard-\r\ndisk.\r\nOperating system 7.5.3 or later","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ad39cb33eadd5209940e78c9c85b387f132d76c","amp;dn":"GrooveMaker+1.1+-+1999+-+Classic+Mac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ad39cb33eadd5209940e78c9c85b387f132d76c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,211,156,179,62,173,213,32,153,64,231,140,156,133,179,135,241,50,215,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
