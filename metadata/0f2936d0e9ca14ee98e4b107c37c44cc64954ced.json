Using both electronic beats and real instruments, Theivery Corporation weave together a multitextured album that cements the duo's reputation as one of the classiest recording acts around. \r\n&quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot; is more than just music to listen to. It's also music to live by. (Customer from Amazon)\r\n\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/ALRiKGe.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n01. Heaven's Gonna Burn Your Eyes    [4:10]\r\n     Vocals â€“ Emiliana Torrini\r\n\r\n02.
