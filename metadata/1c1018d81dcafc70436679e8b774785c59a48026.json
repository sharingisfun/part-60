Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nGuest: Adam Ferrara\r\n\r\nEpisode 289: Anthony is joined by longtime pal Adam Ferrara to bitch about traffic, public transportation, international travel, being too snooty to sit in coach, and germs. The guys laugh about the old days including Antâ€™s wedding, getting out of NY, their â€œcountry friendâ€ Frank, horticulture, bad ass bikes, sissy bikes, having mechanical ability, and Adam having no sense of direction. Adam tells us about speeding while filming Top Gear as well as creating movie cars, his favorite cars to drive, and show stunts, they talk about destroying rental cars, cars accessories, stick vs. automatic, road rage, cars that deal with the elements, and the NASCAR experience. The boys stay with the automotive theme chatting about tricking out cars, asphyxiating yourself, and the â€œplumbing truck Caddy,â€ they get into old movie and remakes, TACS studios, casino gigs, Adam getting into stand-up, Adamâ€™s dad, and gambling shenanigans.\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c1018d81dcafc70436679e8b774785c59a48026","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-12-28+Adam+Ferrara+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c1018d81dcafc70436679e8b774785c59a48026","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,16,24,216,29,202,252,112,67,102,121,232,183,116,120,92,89,164,128,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
