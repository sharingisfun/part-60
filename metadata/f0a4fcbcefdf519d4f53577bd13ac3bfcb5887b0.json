It was discontinued when Studio Canal acquired the distribution rights to the film and released its own Blu-Ray edition in 2010. The Studio Canal Blu-Ray is clearly inferior in basically every observable or quantifiable way to the Criterion edition, which was pressed from an excruciatingly carefully crafted remaster of the film, which involved, among other things, a chemical and digital restoration of the film elements that involved more than 22,000 individual touch-ups to remove specks of dust, dirt and other damage and distortions from the original film. This version is so prized that it now sells for hundreds of dollars on eBay. Film fans should not be deprived of this definitive archival pressing of such an important movie, or be forced to pay hundreds of bucks for it, just because Studio Canal decided to gobble up the rights and release a crappy successor to it, so I post it here because this treasure should be preserved and accessible to film fans everywhere.\r\n\r\nOver at DVDBeaver.com you can find an excellent technical and visual account of the difference between this release and Studio Canal's Blu-Ray (as well as previous DVD releases) with screen captures and disc data:\r\n \nhttp://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDReviews8/thirdman.htm\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\n1949\r\n104 minutes\r\nBlack and White\r\n1.33:1\r\nEnglish\r\n \r\nCriterion Collection Spine #64\r\n\r\nPulp novelist Holly Martins travels to shadowy, postwar Vienna, only to find himself investigating the mysterious death of an old friend, black-market opportunist Harry Limeâ€”and thus begins this legendary tale of love, deception, and murder. Thanks to brilliant performances by Joseph Cotten, Alida Valli, and Orson Welles; Anton Karasâ€™s evocative zither score; Graham Greeneâ€™s razor-sharp dialogue; and Robert Kraskerâ€™s dramatic use of light and shadow, The Third Man, directed by the inimitable Carol Reed, only grows in stature as the years pass.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisc Features\r\nâ€¢New, restored high-definition digital transfer, with uncompressed mono soundtrack on the Blu-ray edition\r\nâ€¢Video introduction by writer-director Peter Bogdanovich\r\nâ€¢Two audio commentaries: one by filmmaker Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter Tony Gilroy, and one by film scholar Dana Polan\r\nâ€¢Shadowing â€œThe Third Manâ€ (2005), a ninety-minute feature documentary on the making of the film\r\nâ€¢Abridged recording of Graham Greeneâ€™s treatment, read by actor Richard Clarke\r\nâ€¢â€œGraham Greene: The Hunted Man,â€ an hour-long, 1968 episode of the BBCâ€™s Omnibus series, featuring a rare interview with the novelist\r\nâ€¢Who Was the Third Man?
