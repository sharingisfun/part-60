Angelova (CRC, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-4987-1539-3\r\n\r\nTextiles and Human Thermophysiological Comfort in the Indoor Environment delivers a methodical assessment of textile structures for various applications in the indoor environment with respect to the thermophysiological comfort of the inhabitants. The book begins by offering an overview of the role of indoor textiles and clothing as a barrier between the environment and the human body, and then:\r\n\r\nExplores the use of textiles as an insulation barrier, examining the relationships between textiles and the environment, and textiles and the human body\r\nDetails an experimental study of heat and mass transfer processes through woven textiles with different applications in the indoor environment\r\nDescribes a numerical investigation of the transport of air and heat through woven fabrics by means of computational fluid dynamics (CFD)\r\nDevelops, applies, and verifies an original approach for simulating the woven macrostructure as a jet system, presenting proven results\r\nEvaluates thermophysiological comfort under the influence of indoor environmental parameters, clothing insulation, and activity\r\n\r\nTextiles and Human Thermophysiological Comfort in the Indoor Environment provides a valuable reference for students and researchers working in the area of clothing comfort","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04ce72e71393e54190874d3b52e3a95ce0512185","amp;dn":"Textiles+and+Human+Thermophysiological+Comfort+in+the+Indoor+Env","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04ce72e71393e54190874d3b52e3a95ce0512185","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,206,114,231,19,147,229,65,144,135,77,59,82,227,169,92,224,81,33,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
