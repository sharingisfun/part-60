The best known are the Workprint, the Theatrical Cut, the International Cut, the Director's Cut[1] and the Final Cut. These five versions are included in both the 2007 5-disc Ultimate Collectors Edition and 2012 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition releases. In the 2007 documentary Dangerous Days: The Making of Blade Runner, there is a reference to director Ridley Scott presenting a nearly four-hour-long &quot;early cut&quot; that was shown only to studio personnel at the time and has never been released.\r\n \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versions_of_Blade_Runner","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bea2356393d229566ea5ebc6fe05d66f813e004b","amp;dn":"Blade+Runner-+Final+Cut+%281997%29.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bea2356393d229566ea5ebc6fe05d66f813e004b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,162,53,99,147,210,41,86,110,165,235,198,254,5,214,111,129,62,0,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
