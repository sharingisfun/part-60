I figured out that what was missing was the preload folder. I copied that out of another GE 44 tonner and edited the two files by converting from .bin to xml and then after editing converting them back to .bin files. They have both been tested and are both working properly in TS2016. The pictures have been brightened as well to look much better in the game. Who else but DigiTizeU would bring you this :-)\r\n\r\nHappy Holidays!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c48a59cbc97d5d7ca030f09048f91006af9e7f2f","amp;dn":"RailWorks+PRR+and+UP+GE+44+Ton+Locos+WORKING%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c48a59cbc97d5d7ca030f09048f91006af9e7f2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,138,89,203,201,125,93,124,160,48,240,144,72,249,16,6,175,158,127,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
