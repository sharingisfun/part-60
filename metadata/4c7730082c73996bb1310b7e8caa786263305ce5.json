Like flushing all my thoughts and feelings out of my system and onto paper. I tell her it's a stupid idea.\r\nBut here I am, writing a letter to a dead girl. Where do I start? Where did our story begin? From the moment you were born...or died?\r\nI'll start with the moment I found out the truth about you. Your lies and my pain. Because it always begins and ends with you.\r\nAnd that end began when Rafe Lawrence came back to town...\r\nAva Hale will do anything to find her sister's killer...although she'll wish she hadn't. Because the harder Ava looks, the more secrets she uncovers about Kesley, and the more she begins to think that the girl she called sister was a liar. A sneak. A stranger.\r\nAnd Kesley's murderer could be much closer than she thought...\r\nA debut novel from Wattpad award-winner Kara Terzis, Frayed is a psychological whodunit that will keep you guessing!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c7730082c73996bb1310b7e8caa786263305ce5","amp;dn":"Frayed+-+Kara+Terzis+-+%7BCHB+Books%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c7730082c73996bb1310b7e8caa786263305ce5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,119,48,8,44,115,153,107,177,49,11,126,140,170,120,98,99,48,92,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
