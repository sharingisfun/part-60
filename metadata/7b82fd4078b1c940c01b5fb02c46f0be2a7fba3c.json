Fireflies seem special because so few other life forms on land can light up the night. But in the dark depths of the oceans, itâ€™s a different story: nearly 90 percent of all species shine from within. Whether itâ€™s to scare off predators, fish for prey or lure a mate, the language of light is everywhere in the ocean depths, and scientists are finally starting to decode it.\r\n\r\nNOVA and National Geographic take a dazzling dive to this hidden undersea world where most creatures flash, sparkle, shimmer, or simply glow. Join deep sea scientists who investigate these stunning displays and discover surprising ways to harness natureâ€™s light â€” from tracking cancer cells to detecting pollution, lighting up cities, and even illuminating the inner workings of our brains.\r\n\r\nFormat : Matroska\r\nFile size : 960 MiB\r\nDuration : 53mn 7s\r\nOverall bit rate : 2 527 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\r\nHeight : 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\nScan type : Progressive\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode : Lossy\r\nLanguage : English\r\n\r\nText\r\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b82fd4078b1c940c01b5fb02c46f0be2a7fba3c","amp;dn":"PBS+NOVA+Creatures+of+Light+720p+x264+HEVCguy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b82fd4078b1c940c01b5fb02c46f0be2a7fba3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,130,253,64,120,177,201,64,192,27,95,176,44,70,240,190,42,127,186,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
