The fastest way to stop stumbling around in Git and to start understanding what you're doing is to learn how Git works.\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nWhen you come to really understand whatâ€™s actually happening under-the-hood, most things that youâ€™ve found mysterious or cryptic about Git will vanish. You go from being puzzled to being a resource, and some of you will go from being users to being contributors.\r\n\r\nThis course provides viewers with knowledge of Gitâ€™s repository pieces and the right mental models for how to use those pieces. Students will be able to compare and contrast the design and performance of Git with its predecessors as well as see the design parallels between Git and Linux. With this knowledge, viewers will understand how to experiment when Git does something unexpected and how to extend Git with new commands.\r\n\r\nIn this course, all work is on the command line, so familiarity with bash is assumed, but no other programming languages are required. Each lesson calls out pause points for viewers to answer specific questions, practice whatâ€™s been explained, and explore related points.\r\n\r\nSkill Level\r\n\r\n-  Intermediate\r\n-  Advanced\r\n\r\nWhat You Will Learn\r\n\r\n-  The varied pieces of Git's repository\r\n-  Basic Git commands and how to use those pieces\r\n-  The design and performance of Git versus its VCS progenitors\r\n-  Design parallels between Git and Linux\r\n-  How to experiment when Git does something unexpected\r\n-  How to extend Git with new commands\r\n\r\nWho Should Take This Course\r\n\r\n- For software developers with some experience using a version control system. Specifically, those developers who know some Git commands.\r\n\r\nCourse Requirements\r\n\r\n- Comfortable using a terminal window/command line\r\n- Basic-level knowledge in working with Git\r\n- Have root-permission access to a Linux computer or VM\r\n \nhttp://www.informit.com/store/git-under-the-hood-livelessons-video-training-downloadable-9780134133669","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4ce915a11e688ae413c4cd7fef8a4d53c341014","amp;dn":"Git+Under+the+Hood+LiveLessons+%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4ce915a11e688ae413c4cd7fef8a4d53c341014","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,206,145,90,17,230,136,174,65,60,76,215,254,248,164,213,60,52,16,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
