Both originating from 1992. The other tracks come from the usual &quot;East West&quot; albums: track 3, 4, 5, 7 and 11 come from 1492: Conquest of Paradise, track 1, 2 and 8 from Oceanic, track 6 and 17 from Voices, 16 from The City, 13 from Blade Runner and 9, 10 and 14 from El Greco (where they used the names/numbers of the commercial release, not the original limited tribute album).\r\nThe tracks have been blended into each other, like earlier on a compilation like Portraits. For this a few little extra sound effects were added, like a few horns from &quot;Bon Voyage&quot; to &quot;Dreams of Surf&quot; and a short timpany roll to start &quot;Monastery of La Rabida&quot;.\r\nBoth unreleased pieces have been re-recorded, or at least represent different recordings from the film versions. &quot;Bitter Moon&quot; is a variation on the opening titles theme and follows the structure of a piece somewhere in the middle of the film, a lot of the synths and strings originate from this scene, but a lead in Vangelis' recognizable cello sample has been replaced by new piano parts, and the whole piece is mixed differently with extra effects, synths and a cymbal sample. &quot;The Plague&quot; is a variation on the end titles song, where a new bridge has been inserted between chorus and verse, most of the accompaniment has been rerecorded, changed to be more simple in the start and more full near the finish with a very low male choir. was also track ending for the found footage film Greystone park 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd5e719d7d09412fb36002fd0d0a3d0a20c4e55c","amp;dn":"Vangelis+-+Reprise+1990+1999+%5BFlac%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd5e719d7d09412fb36002fd0d0a3d0a20c4e55c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,94,113,157,125,9,65,47,179,96,2,253,13,10,61,10,32,196,229,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
