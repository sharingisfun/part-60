But when a friend from the Marines commits suicide, Ash returns to civilization to help the manâ€™s widow with some home repairs. Under her dilapidated porch, he finds more than he bargained for: the largest, ugliest, meanest dog heâ€™s ever encountered . . . and a Samsonite suitcase stuffed with cash and explosives. As Ash begins to investigate this unexpected discovery, he finds himself at the center of a plot that is far larger than he could have imagined . . . and it may lead straight back to the world he thought heâ€™d left for good. Suspenseful and thrilling, and featuring a compelling new hero, The Drifter is an exciting debut from a fresh voice in crime fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3718838aeb272a532fcfd5dde549b87a08dc7c83","amp;dn":"The+Drifter+-+Nicholas+Petrie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3718838aeb272a532fcfd5dde549b87a08dc7c83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,24,131,138,235,39,42,83,47,207,213,221,229,73,184,122,8,220,124,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
