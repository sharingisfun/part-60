Gulliver (Springer, 2012).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-4614-5730-5\r\n\r\nWhat happens when a chemical is released into the environment? It diffuses, disperses, adsorbs, reacts, and/or changes state. To predict and analyze this process, the mathematics of diffusion is applied to lakes, rivers, groundwater, the atmosphere, the oceans, and transport between these media. A sustainable world requires a deep understanding of the transport of chemicals through the environment and how to address and harness this process. This volume presents a succinct and in-depth introduction to this critical topic. Featuring authoritative, peer-reviewed articles from the Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology, Transport and Fate of Chemicals in the Environment represents an essential one-stop reference for an audience of researchers, undergraduate and graduate students, and industry professionals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b092eb4f558d708762ff075328ed66a99d61441","amp;dn":"Transport+and+Fate+of+Chemicals+in+the+Environment","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b092eb4f558d708762ff075328ed66a99d61441","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,9,46,180,245,88,215,8,118,47,240,117,50,142,214,106,153,214,20,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
