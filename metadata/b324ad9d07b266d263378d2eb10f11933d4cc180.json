Abrams | 1966 | ISBN: N/A | English | 514 pages | PDF | 54.8 MB\r\n\r\nThis book is a comprehensive survey of the art in the 1960s. It takes stock of the modern artistic scene, and names its names and displays the results: the 478 illustrations (of which 132 are in full color) show the most characteristic works of our day. Nineteen authors, each of whom is a highly respected authority in his own country, comment on the work and intentions of each artist. The reader himself is called upon to weigh opinions and to discover the common threads that run through the art of our time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b324ad9d07b266d263378d2eb10f11933d4cc180","amp;dn":"New+Art+Around+the+World+-+Painting+and+Sculpture+%28Art+Ebook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b324ad9d07b266d263378d2eb10f11933d4cc180","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,36,173,157,7,178,102,210,99,55,141,46,177,15,17,147,61,76,193,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
