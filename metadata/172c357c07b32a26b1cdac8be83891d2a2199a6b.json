Fifteen years later, Brandon is a protective son and a loyal and respected member of the San Francisco Fire Department, bedding anything in a skirt that promises not to stick around afterward.\r\n\r\nWhen his past and present collide in his dreamsâ€”including his best friend and fellow fireman, Masonâ€”Brandon knows things are never going to be the same again. He starts to recall that fateful day years before, and the long-forgotten feelings that preceded it. The most important thing he remembersâ€”heâ€™s not as straight as heâ€™d thought.\r\n\r\nWith help, Brandon learns to accept who he was always meant to be. But when tragedy strikes again, Brandon must reconcile his past and present and deal with his grief if he is to ever be true, not only to himself, but to Mason as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\n                          Visit us for more Awesome ebooks             \r\n\r\n                               http://booksdeity.com/\r\n \r\n                         **********************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:172c357c07b32a26b1cdac8be83891d2a2199a6b","amp;dn":"True+Blue+by+R.J.+Jones.epub+%5BRetail%5D+%2A%7BBooksDeity%7D%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"172c357c07b32a26b1cdac8be83891d2a2199a6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,44,53,124,7,179,42,38,177,205,172,139,232,56,145,210,162,25,154,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
