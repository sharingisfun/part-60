(Wiley-Scrivener, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-118-93861-4\r\n\r\nThis is the fifth volume in a series of books focusing on natural gas engineering, focusing on the extraction and disposal of acid gas. This volume includes information for both upstream and downstream operations, including chapters on modeling, carbon capture, chemical and thermodynamic models, and much more.\r\n\r\nWritten by some of the most well-known and respected chemical and process engineers working with natural gas today, the chapters in this important volume represent the most cutting-edge and state-of-the-art processes and operations being used in the field. Not available anywhere else, this volume is a must-have for any chemical engineer, chemist, or process engineer working with natural gas.\r\n\r\nThere are updates of new technologies in other related areas of natural gas, in addition to the extraction and disposal of acid gas, including testing, reservoir simulations, acid gas injection, and natural gas hydrate formations. Advances in Natural Gas Engineering is an ongoing series of books meant to form the basis for the working library of any engineer working in natural gas today. Every volume is a must-have for any engineer or library","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48e3a26b8798ca278e2c5de2bce3cc8648eeaa70","amp;dn":"Acid+Gas+Extraction+for+Disposal+and+Relateics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48e3a26b8798ca278e2c5de2bce3cc8648eeaa70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,227,162,107,135,152,202,39,142,44,93,226,188,227,204,134,72,238,170,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
