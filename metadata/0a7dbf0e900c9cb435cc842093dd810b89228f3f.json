Just a collection of german military marches organised into separate albums.\r\nI literally searched the Internet for every single march, then set up\r\nartist name as &quot;Deutsche MilitÃ¤r MÃ¤rsche&quot;.\r\nNext step was to name every single file properly, set up\r\nfile info - artist, march name, track number and album name properly, according\r\nto mr. Stephan's work. I tried to get best quality possible for all marches, but you\r\nhave to understand that some recordings are not available in good quality. And its' JUST mp3.\r\nYou won't find any nazi-era related sh*t in here as it is often with other \r\ngerman military music torrents. Most of these marches come from 18th and 19th century","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a7dbf0e900c9cb435cc842093dd810b89228f3f","amp;dn":"Deutsche+Armeem%26auml%3Brsche+von+Wilhelm+Stephan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a7dbf0e900c9cb435cc842093dd810b89228f3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,125,191,14,144,12,156,180,53,204,132,32,147,221,129,11,137,34,143,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
