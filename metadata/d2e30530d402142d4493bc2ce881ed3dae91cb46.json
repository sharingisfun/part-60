After change their agent, band signed a deal with new studio for full-lenght album (Going Crazy), and made promo-video for MTV - &quot;Wasteland&quot;. Due to technical difficulties, track &quot;Crying Out My Heart&quot; was cut-out and replaced by this two promo-album tracks in new version demo. Unfortunately , this beautiful ballad was never again officially released on any demo or album, and for now exists only as archival radio-single...\r\n\r\nband info: \nhttp://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Sahara/123102","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2e30530d402142d4493bc2ce881ed3dae91cb46","amp;dn":"SAHARA+-+Discography+Complete+%2A1988-1994%2A+%5BMP3%40192-320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2e30530d402142d4493bc2ce881ed3dae91cb46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,227,5,48,212,2,20,45,68,147,188,44,232,129,237,61,174,145,203,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
