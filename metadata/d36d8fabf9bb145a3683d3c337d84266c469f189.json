It's not racism. It's not sexism.  It's not bigotry.  All of the things that the elites and their media cohorts are gonna try to chalk this up to, it's not about any of that.  It's about a desire to be self-reliant because they just don't trust the people who claim to have all the answers and solutions for all the problems.  They don't trust the elites anymore. They don't trust the ruling class. The ruling class has made a mess of pretty much everything.\r\n \nhttp://www.rushlimbaugh.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d36d8fabf9bb145a3683d3c337d84266c469f189","amp;dn":"Rush+Limbaugh+-+June+24%2C+2016+Full+Podcast.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d36d8fabf9bb145a3683d3c337d84266c469f189","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,109,143,171,249,187,20,90,54,131,211,195,55,216,66,102,196,105,241,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
