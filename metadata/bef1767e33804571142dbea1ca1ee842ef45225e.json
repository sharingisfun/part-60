Our sophisticated algorithm simulates the physical properties of fabrics to accurately visualize the way they drape in real-life.\r\nFirst things first: CLO is neither a mobile app nor a magical clothing-scanning device. Itâ€™s a design software that runs on your computer-desktopor laptop, Mac or PC.\r\nIt begins with a 3D body â€“ avatar, body scan, or dress form, available in different shapes andsizes.\r\nStop Chasing. Start Designing.\r\nWith CLO, lead times are reduced from weeks to mere minutes*.\r\nConfirm and fine-tune the 3D before you cut, make, trim, and ship the physical.\r\nEliminate the need for excess sample rounds and over-development, not to mention the costs that come with them.\r\nItâ€™s time to shift the focus away from the chase and back to what really matters the most: your product","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bef1767e33804571142dbea1ca1ee842ef45225e","amp;dn":"CLO+3D+Enterprise+2.4.57+Online+Auth+%28Cracked%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bef1767e33804571142dbea1ca1ee842ef45225e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,241,118,126,51,128,69,113,20,45,190,161,202,30,232,66,239,69,34,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
