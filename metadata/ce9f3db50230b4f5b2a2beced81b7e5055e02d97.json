Journalist Mona Chalabi investigates whether these statistics provide an accurate picture.\r\n\r\nTo find out what is happening on Britain's streets, three reporters are sent undercover to test the public's prejudice. The results are surprising.\r\n\r\nThe programme looks into people's subconscious behaviour, discovering what British people really think about their neighbours of different races and religions. And Mona puts her own beliefs under the microscope, discovering some uncomfortable truths. Finally, she asks a hugely significant question - can people be trained to lose their prejudice?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce9f3db50230b4f5b2a2beced81b7e5055e02d97","amp;dn":"Is+Britain+Racist","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce9f3db50230b4f5b2a2beced81b7e5055e02d97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,159,61,181,2,48,180,245,178,162,190,206,216,27,126,80,85,224,45,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
