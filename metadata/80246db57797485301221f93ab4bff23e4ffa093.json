Chinesta, G. Ausias (ISTE, 2015).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-78548-036-2\r\n\r\nThis book provides a review of the current understanding of the behavior of non-spherical particle suspensions providing experimental results, rheological models and numerical modeling. In recent years, new models have been developed for suspension rheology and as a result applications for nanocomposites have increased.\r\n\r\nThe authors tackle issues within experimental, model and numerical simulations of the behavior of particle suspensions. Applications of non-spherical particle suspension rheology are widespread and can be found in organic matrix composites, nanocomposites, biocomposites, fiber-filled fresh concrete flow, blood and biologic fluids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnderstand how to model and predict the final microstructure and properties of particle suspensions\r\nExplores nano, micro, meso and macro scales\r\nRheology, thermomechanical and electromagnetic physics are discussed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80246db57797485301221f93ab4bff23e4ffa093","amp;dn":"Rheology+of+Non-Spherical+Particle+Suspensions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80246db57797485301221f93ab4bff23e4ffa093","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,36,109,181,119,151,72,83,1,34,31,147,171,75,255,35,228,255,160,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
