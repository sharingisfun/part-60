Will this odd couple be able to laugh their way through the pressure of the instant restaurant?\r\nCheryl and Matt QLD\r\nWe can laugh at any situation! \r\nHailing from Brisbane, sales/marketing manager Cheryl and student Matt are used to people misinterpreting their relationship. Mum-of-one Cheryl, 50, has been happily dating 26 year-old Matt for the past 18 months and says he won her over with his chicken Caesar salad.\r\nWhat do you think about being a â€˜cougarâ€™ Cheryl?\r\nWe want to say to everyone out there that age doesnâ€™t matter. Why should a number make a difference about who youâ€™re with, who you enjoy your time with and how you go through life. Society shouldnâ€™t dictate that.\r\nMatt: Yeah it might seem weird but thereâ€™s 50 year-old men going out with 18 year-old women and thatâ€™s not frowned upon in society. What weâ€™re doing is something that is showing that females have a right to do whatever they want and if we enjoy each otherâ€™s company, then it doesnâ€™t matter.\r\nWhatâ€™s your vibe like in the kitchen?\r\nMatt: When weâ€™re 100 percent in sync weâ€™re pretty good. Iâ€™m usually naked though!\r\nCheryl: Weâ€™re usually having a few drinks and listening to some music. Matt is pretty good at grabbing whatever is in the fridge and putting it all together. Being a student (he is studying HR), and having to make ends meet, heâ€™s really good like that. He makes it taste so good and look so good. We laugh a lot.\r\nIs there a head chef?\r\nCheryl: Usually Matt is the head chef with all the savoury stuff, unless Iâ€™m in control mode.\r\nMatt: Then thereâ€™s no point in telling her what to do because sheâ€™ll do it her way anyway.\r\nMost used ingredients?\r\nMatt: Whatever is in season - thereâ€™s no point buying things out of season as itâ€™s just not viable.\r\nHow do you cope under pressure?\r\nMatt: Usually we cope well if weâ€™ve planned things out properly. I like to have an idea of how things are going to unfold.\r\nCheryl: Heâ€™s the calming influence on me. I donâ€™t stress but I panic a little bit; I get a bit anxious. Heâ€™ll do something crazy like dance with me or say something stupid. Laughter always works for us; it gets us back on track.\r\nMatt: If I see sheâ€™s under pressure I always try to bring her out of it, then she forgets what happened.\r\nWhat are your hobbies other than cooking?\r\nCheryl: I go to the gym and play tennis and do a bit of gardening. We have a great veggie patch. We mainly have herbs but also beautiful tomatoes, shallots, kale and spinach. Mattâ€™s dad has a veggie patch and he brings back sweet potato and turmeric when we cook.\r\nMatt: I like looking at the financial market and being up to date with whatâ€™s going on in the world.\r\nWhat do you see as your biggest strength in the competition?\r\nCheryl: We can laugh at any situation and think about it as a â€˜glass half fullâ€™ opportunity and the two of us together are stronger than singly.\r\nWhat about your biggest weakness?\r\nMatt: It might be our laughter as well because sometimes we donâ€™t seem to take things seriously. Because we have this front of being idiots, people look at us and think weâ€™re not serious.\r\nAre you competitive people?\r\nCheryl: Both of us have swum competitively, but I was never at the level Matt was (he was the fastest breaststroker in Queensland as a teenager). But we are competitive people, even with each other.\r\nMatt: Yeah even if weâ€™re driving separate cars weâ€™ll try to beat each other back to the house","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3811228538bd6afc3ad8d3aaa25f21822cb9806","amp;dn":"My.Kitchen.Rules.s07e03.WS.PDTV.x264.BF1.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3811228538bd6afc3ad8d3aaa25f21822cb9806","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,129,18,40,83,139,214,175,195,173,141,58,170,37,242,24,34,203,152,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
