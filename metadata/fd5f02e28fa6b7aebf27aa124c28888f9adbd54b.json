I have amended some transition scenes and added a few previously removed scenes here and there that I had wished we're in Dustin's movie.\r\n\r\nI have also re-added color to the first part of the movie as I feel the movie suffered when the color was mellowed down.\r\n\r\nHope you enjoy this\r\nCheers\r\n \r\n\r\nPS. None of this would have been possible without Dustin Lee and I'd like to thank him","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd5f02e28fa6b7aebf27aa124c28888f9adbd54b","amp;dn":"JRR+Tolkien%27s+The+Hobbit+Extended+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd5f02e28fa6b7aebf27aa124c28888f9adbd54b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,95,2,226,143,166,183,174,191,39,170,18,76,40,136,143,154,219,213,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
