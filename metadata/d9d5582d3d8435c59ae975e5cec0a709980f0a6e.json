She was singing at the Ravanastro - songs by Socratis Malamas, the repertoire she made her name with - and as I sat there watching, listening, it came to me that two â€˜traditionsâ€™ in Greek popular song had come together in her. \r\nNow, although many would dismiss the first â€˜traditionâ€™ as a detail concealing nothing of any depth, I see it differently: Melina could sing sitting on a chair among the musicians in the band - casting our minds back to times past, to Tsitsanis and the others - and still be the central figure in the song. A heroine who did not need to stand in front of everyone else to convey her interpretation and her feelings to the audience. Not that she was unconcerned about the image she was projecting; on the contrary, like any woman singing on a stage she had her fair share of femininity and coquetry, but she was so natural with it that everyone could see her female charms were effortless and real, and that she had no need of ploys or gimmicks.\r\nThe second tradition lay in her voice. There were two schools of Greek popular singing: that of Smyrna, the nasal voices that brought such a unique balance to the high notes, and the contraltos, whose marvellous bass made them the queens of the lower registers. Now, it is my entirely subjective opinion that it was the second group - the contraltos - who wrote the history of post rembetika Greek song.\r\nTradition is underfire in contemporary Greek song, and Melina Kana is one of only a handful of artists from her generation who keep it alive in their work. This, coupled with the fact that she consistently steers clear of what is ephemeral or easy in her choice of material, makes Melina Kana very special indeed.\r\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                     Odysseus loannou\r\n\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/RXQo88e.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n01.
