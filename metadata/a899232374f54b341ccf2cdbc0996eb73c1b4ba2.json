They take the manager, Claire Keesey, hostage, but\r\nrelease her unharmed. When they find out Claire lives in their neighborhood\r\nDoug begins to follow her to find out how much she has told the authorities\r\nand to make sure that Jem does not eliminate her as a witness. Soon a romance\r\ngrows between them, which Doug hides from the gang. As they grow closer, Doug\r\ntells Claire of his search for his long-lost mother, whom he believes went to\r\nlive with his aunt in Tangerine, Florida. He also recounts his chance to be a\r\nprofessional hockey player which he threw away for a life of crime, following\r\nin his father's footsteps. She in turn tells Doug that she saw a tattoo on one\r\nof the robbers, and he realizes that she can identify Jem and send them all to\r\njail. He knows that Jem will kill her if he discovers the truth, so he persuades\r\nher that the authorities cannot protect her, and she decides not to tell the police\r\n\r\nBox Office\r\n\r\nBudget: $37,000,000 (estimated)\r\nOpening Weekend: $23,808,032 (USA) (17 September 2010)\r\nGross: $92,173,235 (USA) (31 December 2010)\r\nWorldwide: $154,026,136 (Worldwide)/$61,839,874 (Non-USA)\r\n\r\nPlease note that all screenshot was captured at 1080p, resized to 720p\r\nand then compressed using PNG to improve the loading time.\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/07782879935356503552.png  \r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/59397331371843808563.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/85766533027307587691.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/36081829187282874253.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/69283642448529702196.png  \r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/03523460339812989614.png\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0840361/\r\n\r\n:: General ::\r\n\r\nFormat: Matroska/MKV\r\nFile Size: 12.1 GiB\r\nOverall Bit Rate: 11.5 Mbps\r\nFormat profile:   \r\nDuration: 02:30:17\r\nSample: Yes\r\nSubtitles: English\r\nChapters: Yes\r\nEncoded By oneanight\r\n\r\n:: Video Info ::\r\n\r\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\r\nWriting library: x264\r\nVideo bitrate: 10 MB\r\nResolution: 1920 X 800 pixels\r\nAspect ratio(AR): 2.40:1\r\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\r\n\r\n:: Audio Info ::\r\n\r\nFormat profile: DTS\r\nAudio Bit rate: 1509 Kbps\r\nCompression mode: Lossless\r\nBit rate mode Constant\r\nAudio Language: English\r\nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz / Bit depth 24 bits\r\nChannel positions: Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\r\nChannels: 6 channels 5.1 Surround\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a899232374f54b341ccf2cdbc0996eb73c1b4ba2","amp;dn":"The+Town+-+Extended+%5B2010%5D+1080p+BDRip+x264+DTS+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a899232374f54b341ccf2cdbc0996eb73c1b4ba2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,153,35,35,116,245,75,52,28,207,44,219,192,153,110,183,60,27,75,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
