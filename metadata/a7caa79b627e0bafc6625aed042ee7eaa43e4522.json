We call these freshwater seas the Great Lakes. The five connected bodies, which together form America's fourth coast, have played a fundamental role in the history of North America and - because their resources-rich basin became the heartland of American industrial might - the history of the world as well. The region's ecosystem contains more than 3,500 species of plants and animals, including some that are found nowhere else in the world, and its economy is one of the most diverse on the continent, home to half of Canada's manufacturing capacity and one-fifth the manufacturing capacity of the United States. For the first time, American television audiences get a close-up, in-depth look at this amazing natural phenomenon in a 2-hour documentary, Freshwater Seas: The Great Lakes, filmed in partnership with Detroit Public Television.  \r\n\r\nProduced &amp; Directed by Lindsey Haskins for WTVS-TV/Detroit Public Television\r\n\r\n2)  Reparation \r\nWhether we have experienced the awe-inspiring waters in person, or merely as a familiar landmark on the map of the continent, all Americans have been enriched by the Great Lakes. This program tells why, and why we should care about their future.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6a/Freshwater-Seas-The-Great-Lakes-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f1/Freshwater-Seas-The-Great-Lakes-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/87/Freshwater-Seas-The-Great-Lakes-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e7/Freshwater-Seas-The-Great-Lakes-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/04/Freshwater-Seas-The-Great-Lakes-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/64/Freshwater-Seas-The-Great-Lakes-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b5/Freshwater-Seas-The-Great-Lakes-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/58/Freshwater-Seas-The-Great-Lakes-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8f/Freshwater-Seas-The-Great-Lakes-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1f/Freshwater-Seas-The-Great-Lakes-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b4/Freshwater-Seas-The-Great-Lakes-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ea/Freshwater-Seas-The-Great-Lakes-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a0/Freshwater-Seas-The-Great-Lakes-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/85/Freshwater-Seas-The-Great-Lakes-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0c/Freshwater-Seas-The-Great-Lakes-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a4/Freshwater-Seas-The-Great-Lakes-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: 3 381 Kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Per Second: 29.970 fps\r\nAudio Codec: AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate: 384 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\r\nAudio Streams: 6\r\nAudio Languages: english\r\nRunTime Per Part: 55mn\r\nNumber Of Parts: 2\r\nPart Size: 1.44 GB\r\nSource: HDTV (Thanks to TrollHD)\r\nEncoded by: DocFreak08\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nSource: \nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Freshwater_Seas:_The_Great_Lakes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7caa79b627e0bafc6625aed042ee7eaa43e4522","amp;dn":"PBS+Freshwater+Seas+The+Great+Lakes+2of2+Reparation+720p+x264+AC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7caa79b627e0bafc6625aed042ee7eaa43e4522","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,202,167,155,98,126,11,175,198,98,90,237,4,46,231,234,164,62,69,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
