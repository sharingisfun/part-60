The book explores all of the widely-used modern types of motor and drive, including conventional and brushless D.C., induction motors and servo drives, providing readers with the knowledge to select the right technology for a given job.\r\n\r\nThe third edition includes additional diagrams and worked examples throughout. New topics include digital interfacing and control of drives, direct torque control of induction motors and current-fed operation in DC drives. The material on brushless servomotors has also been expanded.\r\n\r\nAustin Hughes' approach, using a minimum of maths, has established Electric Motors and Drives as a leading guide for electrical engineers and mechanical engineers, and the key to a complex subject for a wider readership, including technicians, managers and students. \r\n\r\n* Acquire knowledge of and understanding of the capabilities and limitations of motors and drives without struggling through unnecessary maths and theory\r\n* Updated material on the latest and most widely-used modern motors and drives, including brushless servomotors\r\n* New edition includes additional diagrams and worked examples throughout","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23fcd8cbb9be0054ab69acc40ea2b88fae06ac82","amp;dn":"Electric+Motors+and+Drives%3A+Fundamentals%2C+Types+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23fcd8cbb9be0054ab69acc40ea2b88fae06ac82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,252,216,203,185,190,0,84,171,105,172,196,14,162,184,143,174,6,172,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
