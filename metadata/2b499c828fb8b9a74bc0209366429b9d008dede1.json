Some peers took only 12 min to download 1.6GB.  Now that is torrenting.\r\n\r\nThis is a living, working, commercial collection and as such is dynamic and updated every few days, so you will find January 2016 releases in this listing as we make our way to the end.\r\n\r\n300 More CDG+MP3 Karaoke songs from the Rigmar Radio 2015 Collection, now with Multiple Karaoke Label choice on the more popular songs.   All tracks are optomised, following industry guidelines for the naming of music files to give good search results from PC or MAC playout software.\r\n\r\n1.  No Karaoke catalogue alpha numeric file names\r\n2.  No back to front Artist names\r\n3.  Proper Case\r\n4.  No MAC _._ nonsense\r\n5.  No Beatles, The strings.  The word 'The' is not used in the Artist string.\r\n6.  No ,A at the end of the song title string either.\r\n\r\nIt is common sense, long overdue and when the f@*k are the Karaoke companies going to give us working DJ's what WE WANT as customers and not what is backward compatible with obsolete Laser and CD Karaoke players.\r\n\r\nRigmar Radio - Seeding to the World since 2004","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b499c828fb8b9a74bc0209366429b9d008dede1","amp;dn":"Rigmar+Radio+Karaoke+Collection+32600","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b499c828fb8b9a74bc0209366429b9d008dede1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,73,156,130,143,184,185,167,75,192,32,147,102,66,155,157,0,141,237,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
