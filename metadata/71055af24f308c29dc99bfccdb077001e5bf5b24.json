Shortly after the tape's release, Pentacle gained stage experience supporting bands such as Asphyx and Gorefest.\r\n\r\n\r\nYear: 1987 - 2012\r\nCountry: Netherlands\r\nGenre: Death Metal\r\nCodec: Mp3\r\nBitrate: Various\r\nSize: 603 MB\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscography:\r\n1992 - Caressed by both sides\r\n1993 - Winds Of The Fall (demo)\r\n1995 - Exalted Journey (EP)\r\n1996 - The Fifth Moon (EP)\r\n1998 - Rides the Moonstorm (Full-length)\r\n2000 - ...In league with...
