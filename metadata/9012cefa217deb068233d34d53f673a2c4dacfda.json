Since 1992, the band has consisted of Joe Elliott (lead vocals), Rick Savage (bassist, backing vocals), Rick Allen (drums, backing vocals), Phil Collen (guitar, backing vocals), and Vivian Campbell (guitar, backing vocals). This is the band's longest-standing line-up.\r\n\r\nThe band's strongest commercial success came between the early 1980s and the early 1990s. Their 1981 album High 'n' Dry was produced by Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange, who helped them begin to define their style, and the album's stand out track &quot;Bringin' On the Heartbreak&quot; became one of the first rock videos played on MTV in 1982. The band's next studio album Pyromania in January 1983, with &quot;Photograph&quot; as the lead single, turned Def Leppard into a household name. In the U.S, Pyromania was certified Diamond (10Ã— Platinum). In 2003, the album ranked number 384 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\r\n\r\nAn eleventh studio album, titled Def Leppard, was recorded in 2014 and 2015, and released on 30 October 2015. The band released the lead single from their self-titled album on 15 September 2015, titled &quot;Let's Go&quot;, with a music video for the song being released on 30 October. The 14 track album debuted at number 10 on the Billboard 200 in the U.S.\r\nAnd there are some cuts on this compilation from it which makes this the most complete Def Lep compilation at this time, analogkid again\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\nCD-1\r\n 01.
