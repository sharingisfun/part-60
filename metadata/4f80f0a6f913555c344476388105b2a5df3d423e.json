On October 1, 1943 Nazi leader Adolf Hitler ordered Danish Jews to be arrested and deported. Despite great personal risk, the Danish resistance movement with the assistance of many ordinary Danish citizens took part in a collective effort to evacuate about 7,800 Jews of Denmark by sea to nearby neutral Sweden.\r\n    The rescue allowed the vast majority of Denmark's Jewish population to avoid capture by the Nazis and is considered to be one of the largest actions of collective resistance to repression in the countries occupied by Nazi Germany. As a result of the rescue and Danish intercession on behalf of the 5% of Danish Jews who were deported to Theresienstadt transit camp in Bohemia, over 99% of Denmark's Jewish population survived the Holocaust.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was a Wonderful World of Disney TV movie.  It makes a good companion story to the children's book &quot;Number the Stars&quot; by Lois Lowry, which is about the same event","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f80f0a6f913555c344476388105b2a5df3d423e","amp;dn":"Miracle+at+Midnight+%281998%29+Wonderful+World+of+Disney","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f80f0a6f913555c344476388105b2a5df3d423e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,128,240,166,249,19,85,92,52,68,118,56,129,5,178,165,223,61,66,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
